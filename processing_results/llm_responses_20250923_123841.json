    "full_transcription": "Let's just start at the beginning. When we come into the world, everyone's looking at us. And what they're wondering, what they're hoping we could become, is limited only by imagination. As soon as we're old enough, we're the ones who start hoping. Hoping that we could be different, elite, whatever you want to call it. That through all the inevitable struggles, we could just have that kind of talent, that gift of being better than everyone else. That's something we love to do. So right now I'd like you to meet Tiger Woods. You wonder what it would feel like if we were one of them, blessed by the sports gods, won some kind of lottery, and got to do all those cool things that only they get to experience. But here's the thing, it's not that easy. And you don't always just know. Like this guy. I've always told myself, if you ever get this opportunity, you better be ready to take advantage. Had to fight for a starting job in college. Passed up by every team in the league. But now, he's the one they're calling the goat. Mom, are you proud of me? A gift? Don't even try to make sense of it. But for this kid, it's a little easier to explain. His father was a pro, so the genetics, the expectations, they were all kind of there from the start. Kansas City Chiefs select Patrick Mahone. Even if no one could have predicted all this. 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns. This fast. Only the second player in the National Football League to do so. Well now, here they are. 41 years old, and just 23. Take advantage of the day. He throws it for six with his left hand. A legacy cemented. Tom Brady. It never gets old. A superstar just starting out. Oh my gosh. Leading two great teams, two franchises, and millions of people. Kansas City! Oh yeah! Inspired by all they're capable of. With us today, we have Tommy Brady. Ouch! But going back to the beginning, remember, they started out just like the rest of us. Their stories, limited by just the imagination. Surrounded by the hope that they would be one of the chosen ones, whose talent could take them to a game like this. Brady and the Patriots. Mahomes and the Chiefs. Tonight, in Kansas City, where their gift has taken them. One game away. From Super Bowl LII. To the starting line, so the Patriots on offense. Wide receivers, you got Chris Hogan and Julian Edelman. They're tackles, Trent Brown and Marcus Cannon. Guards are Joe Tooney and Shaq Mason. David Andrews is your center. You're tied in is Rob Gronkowski. The backs, Sony, Michelle, and James White. And quarterback is number 12, Tom Brady. Coin Toss is brought to you by Clinton Savings Bank. Don't play heads or tails with your business.

Kansas City has won the opening coin toss. They have elected to defend, meaning the Patriots will receive to start the AFC championship game. Offense takes the field first and has set the scene here. So my broadcast partner has been with you all year long. And your voice to the Patriots, Bob Sose. All right, so thanks so much. The Chiefs are wearing their classic home uniforms. The red jerseys with the white numerals outlined in gold. The white pants with the red helmet as well. Trying to reach the Super Bowl for the first time since Hank Stramm coached on the sideline in a blazer in Super Bowl IV against the Minnesota Vikings. Patriots, of course, try to get back to the pinnacle of the NFL for the third straight year for the fourth time in the last five. As the defending AFC champs in their road white jerseys with the navy blue pants and the silver helmets. And Cordero Patterson set to return to our right. He's played in frigid conditions like these in the past. Not only last week, but as a Minnesota Viking. One of the coldest games on record in NFL history against the Seattle Seahawks. For years ago in the wild card round. Game time temperature now at 19 degrees. The wind chill at seven. Wind out of the east at 10 to 20 miles per hour. And it's done nothing to muffle the noise in these layered fans here in Kansas City. They couldn't nail a weather report at home. They can't nail one in Kansas City. Two erroneous reports of a storm back there where we were supposed to get a ton of snow. And all of a sudden the temperatures were supposed to rise near 30 today. A kick. Please. Seven degrees. Bucker has a teed up to our left at the 35. On the natural grass surface, re-sodded. You can see a lot of the seams of the patchwork quilt of green. And a kick left to right. Into the end zone. Patterson runs it out. Three yards deep to the five, to the 10. Right side 15. Patterson out to the 20 yard line. And he is dropped there with that run back by Garrick Dieter. Wide receiver side off the practice squad by KC. Patrons will go right to left with Tom Brady playing in his 39th playoff game in his 13th AFC Championship. And you can hear the noise. The Pats have lost their last three road games in an AFC title contest at Indianapolis. And then twice at Denver including January 2016. The beginning here out of the eye. Sonya Michelle in the red shoes. Stands behind James Devlin. Rangowski the tight end right with two receivers left for the Patriots. Brady turns and gives to Michelle. Runs through a big hole left side. Across the 25, 30. And he shoulders the defender. Eric Berry at the 31. Absorbing the hit. Picking up 11 for a first down carry. Straight power eye. Reverse by the quarterback. And what I like before the snap, the tell back Sonya Michelle. Clopping his hands saying let's go. Give me the rock. Sonya ran it for 100 plus against the Chiefs in the regular season. And he scored two touchdowns in that game. He's coming off the first 100 yard performance by a Patriot rookie in a postseason contest. With three touchdowns against LA. Two tight ends stacked to the right. Offset eye with Devlin to the right. And now Allen in motion to the left to join Edelman there. Brady under center. Drops back with a give. Michelle runs it up the middle. And he is cut down as he crosses the line of scrimmage. Plunging out the 32 yard line. Good work by Alvin Bailey up front for Kansas City. Look to me like that left foot slipped right on that left hash mark. Same sort of give. An offside give. They bring motion across the formation. Now a gain of a yard there. Second and long. Got to be good here. In the first meeting of these teams in week six, the Patriots won the coin toss. Took the football. And they went for it on fourth down on the game's opening drive and were turned away. Now they have a second down and nine from the left hash of the 32. With Edelman to the right Patterson motions that way. Brady for the play fake. And a drop settling in. Throwing down the middle. Glock makes the catch. Crossing right to left. Wrapped up and tackled by Sorensen at the 45 yard line. Two first downs for the Patriots on this opening drive. Little pep in the step for big number 87. But it's the motion away. And it's Cordell Patterson enduring the first series. Motion away left to right. Play fake. Drag the big tight end. They're dosed in Kansas City with their own type of misdirection. It's a 13 yard pick up for the big boys. Sarah Sorensen and Barry were not in the line up for Kansas City in week six. The two safeties are back up. Injured reserve. Now out of the eye. From the near hash for the 45. Brady with a give and running it to the right side. And brought down at the line of scrimmage. With McCarrie Sonia Michelle trying to run it behind Devlin. Nothing doing up front for the Pats second and tenth. It's okay. Keep that push going. But it's just so hard to come off on the snap count. Where there is no snap count. It's David Andrews bobbing ahead looking up. And he needs, he's going to have to move that around a little bit throughout the course of the game. That's where they got into trouble with Stork on the road. Out in Denver a couple years ago. Second down and tenth on the right hash of the 45. With Gronk to put a hand down. Tight end right. Edelman along with Hogan. To the left. Right up in the back to Burkhead. Now he motions left. As Brady drops back looking to throw underneath for Gronkowski at the 50. And he's tackled on the numbers. Undercut by Charvarius Ward. A rookie quarterback required from Dallas. Moving into the starting line up. That's a pick up of six to set up a third down and four. Could even went in the flat to Devlin. But it's motion away. Where you get the flow going with Burkhead. And it opens up the hole and a quick hitter to Gronkowski to the right. Opening drive three minutes off the clock in this AFC championship. Gronk now flex to the right. Three receivers left. Door set. Hogan and Edelman. To the left of Brady James White. As the quarterback stands left foot forward. Extending the hands and taking the snap. A give to James White. Runs it right side. Gets a block from Mason. And then he turns forward to the first down carry across the 45 of Kansas City. Anthony Hitchens and Jordan Lucas collaborate on the stop. It's excellent feet by Shaq Mason getting outside. It's a quick give underneath to James White on the drag. Right, left to right. Little draw. But he lowers the shoulder when he sees the sticks to pick up the first down. Patriots in the middle of a pretty good opening drive here. They got to keep it going. James White has reached 500 total yards in his postseason career. Gives way to Michelle from the eye. A first and ten from the Chiefs 44. Two receivers right. Brady with a give to Michelle. Runs it to the left side. He's brought down at the 40 yard line. Michelle with a pick up of four. The big thing right there. Staying true to the fullback. Follows him. I could see a little daylight to that back side. So get ready for that cut back. Yeah, that's where he could pop on. Now Michelle departs to the far side line. The Patriots are the second down at six as the ball splits to Hashmarts. At the Kansas City 40. Edelman in the red gloves. Trots to the right. Outside of Dwayne Allen. Give you the tight end there with a hand down. Gronk the tight end left. And out of the eye. Devlin up in front of Burkett. He now sprints in motion. Flexing right to draw a linebacker in coverage. As Brady drops back looking to throw. He fires to Burkett. Makes the catch. Shy of the 35. And he's driven back by Hitchens to the far side line. The forward progress to the Chiefs 36. Setting up a third and two. You know what you got here. A lot of motion. A lot of guys with great attention to detail. Getting the feet set. Everybody's on the same page. Which tells you the focus and the walk throughs this week. The ball now to the forward progress. Spotted to 35. This could be two down territory given the weather conditions. It's a third and one from the 35 of Kansas City. Two receivers left. Edelman motions to the right. Brady with a check. Shifts James White from his right hip to his left. Short motion by Edelman White against the man coverage. Brady takes the step. Gives to White. Dances up the middle. Has a first down. Swirling through as he runs it to the 33. To Craig Check with the spread. It brings Edelman in short motion. Right to left. It's an underneath give. On a draw. I'll tell you what. This opening drive. What are you doing? You're going to your money players. James White. Nice job by Michelle. You got Gronkowski with two big catches. To start the drive. To get his confidence up and running here early. And a first and ten after the two yard gain by White. Burkett now the single back. With Edelman along with Hogan. Tied to the right outside of Gronkowski. Door set. The lone split left. Brady's up under center with hand signals to his right. And then to his left. He sets the protections. Edelman moves in short motion from the right. Brady drops back. Hands it off to Burkett. He cuts it left. He's hit a little hole. And he's dropped at the 30 yard line. The tackle made by Breland Speaks. It's a gain of three. Patriots have already chewed six minutes o'clock. And that's part of you know. Playing that controlled offense. Keeping the ball away from Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid. Second and seven. Second down and seven from the right hash of the 31 of Kansas City. On the game's opening drive with Cordero Patterson. In the line up right outside of Edelman. And outside of Gronkowski. Hogan split left with Brady in the gun. He has James White to his right. Looks like man coverage with a fake of a screen white. And then he tries to drop it off underneath. And the pass is left at the ankles of White incomplete. Brady rushed to the bit after pumping toward Cordero Patterson. Brady's going to want to have that one back. He had to get it over the unstretched hand of Justin Hamilton. Yeah it's Hamilton. D-Ford was around Trent Brown. I think that alerted him a little bit. To try and get rid of that ball quicker than he wanted to. It's a big third seven man. Third down and seven for the Patriots again. With the football across the 31 of Kansas City. Gronkowski flex to the right. And he draws the rookie ward. Meanwhile three receivers wide to the left. With White to the right of Brady. Again to set the protections. White splits up front for Kansas City. The Chief will rush five. And Brady throws down the middle. Open at him and slides down at the 16 yard line. And takes a hit from a diving Sorensen. A first down completion. Money drive to your money players. Gronkowski to White. To White with the runs. And then you go to the Ironman on third and seven. Deep drag left to right. Great pocket on a delayed blitz pickup by this offensive line. Man. What a drive to open this football game. Chiefs wound up rushing six. Brady connecting with Edelman down the middle. Now Julian in the right slot. Inside of Hogan. Gronkowski tied in left from the offset high. At the Kansas City 16 yard line. Luchel the tail of the tandem. Stands hands on knees. Brady under center. Drops back and gives to Michelle. Runs through a big hole. Right to the ten. And Michelle is tripped up. A saving play. By the sprawling defender. For Kansas City. And he spills to the six yard line. Close to the first down marker. Unreal job. They're going to give him a first down after that tackle. It appeared by Sorensen. Brady right to the offensive line. After the run to get him together. To talk about this next play. To try and get it in before the noise level elevates. First and goal to go. Just outside the five. With Michelle the single back. Three to the left including Gronk on the way. Meanwhile Edamon split to the right. Gronkowski motions to the right. His man coverage with a give to Michelle. Runs it to the right. Slicing through the line. Fighting toward the goal line. And he twists and turns to the one. Second and goal to go. This kid's a stud. No opening drive right here. A lot of concern. What's a rookie running back? Your former first round pick. How's he going to act in the first big road playoff game? Meanwhile you've got an injured defender for Kansas City. It's not Barry is it? Xavier Williams it appears. Defensive lineman. On the turf. Will be attended to. We get a timeout in the midst of the first drive of the game. And the Patriots are knocking on the door. The Patriots have driven 79 yards to the Kansas City one. Before a second and goal to go. Snap from the right hash mark. Two tight ends left. An extra tackle right. Out of the eye with Devlin the full back for Michelle. Short motion by Allen left with a reset. A give to Michelle. Runs it left into the end zone. Touchdown Patriots. New England strikes first. That's the way you open up an AFC title game on the road. You get your offense out there and you take 15 plays and you shove it right down their throat. With your rookie running back. That is a big boy drive. 15 plays. 80 yards. More importantly 8 minutes and 5 seconds you took off the clock. And Pat Mahomes has not touched the football. Now Steven Gostkowski must convert the point after a try from the spot of Ryan Allen. After the snap by Joe Cardona. Gostkowski in the staggered stance. Had 19 points in the first meeting of these teams. Snap and plays. Kick airborne to the uprights. And the kick is good. What a great start for the Patriots. On the opening possession. They drive to a 7-0 lead on the fourth touchdown in this postseason career by Sony Michelle. Look at the sideline exploded after. The energy that Brady brought to that huddle. The focus. That's what's impressive here. The decibel level. This crowd was humming. They came out ready to go. And you just methodically went 80 yards right down the middle of the field. You got everybody involved. You got the tight end going early. So the confidence level of the tight end. It's got to be feeling pretty good. You're involved in the game plan. Burkett gets a ball. Edelman with the clutch. Third down catch. The Ironman over the middle. And then the rookie running back. Right off tackle. And there's nothing sexy. We're just saying we're going to line up. And we're going between the tackles. There's no misdirection. There's no counter. Man. Great job, Josh McDaniels. That's a canvas right there that he just painted. And so that third down conversion. Brady to Edelman right down the middle for 14 yards. Of course a key play to the Kansas City 16. Huge. Huge. And New England will tee it up to our right. Goscowski soon to kick off. The Chiefs very dangerous with their return game. We know that firsthand Traymon Smith. And unknown back in week six is the sixth round draft pick out of Central Arkansas. Ran a kickoff back 97 yards. The Patriots have since shored up their coverage unit. The acquisitions of Albert McClellan and Ramon Humbert. But they have the work cut out for them in this game with Messers, Smith and Tyreek Hill on punt return. Longest playoff drive of Tom Brady's career. That's just that's amazing to open it up that way. From the right side, 35. Goscowski runs up to swing the right leg and he drives the kick. A line or end over at into the end zone. Three yards deep right down the middle. The Smith takes it back to the 10 to the 15 yard line. And he is hit by Keon Crossharn. The rookie continues to come on as he drops the return man. Traymon Smith at the 16 yard line. Boys that come out flat today. I tell you that they came here ready to play. Great job by Crossharn weaving and moving down the football field. It's a good kick by Goscowski. Sets of two yards deep. He brings it out and you set him up on the 16 based on the tackle by the young rookie. Now you got to play defense. Now Patrick Mahomes the second year quarterback. 18 years younger than Tom Brady. Stands in the pistol as he motions Tyreek Hill to the left. Two receivers right to left including Kelsey in the slot. A give to Damian Williams. Stretching to the right. Dots it back and Williams is tackled across the 20 yard line. Dropped at the 21. And the play made for the Patriots by Kyle Van Noy. So you get the motion with Hill out of the backfield and immediately it's Jonathan Jones with him. They're a man right now and it's Gilmore on Watkins as I predicted. Chiefs are going left to right with the ball. Manera hash. The right hash of the 21 after the five yard gain by Damian Williams. Filling in for Kareem Hunt after he was released and the former Dolphin has played very well. To the right of Mahomes from the pistol. Three receivers to the wide side left. Watkins to the right. And the shotgun snap with a give to Williams. Tackle to the backfield. He landed. Robert shoots a gap and he makes the stop. The ball comes loose. That boy landed. In the end it appeared but Williams able to cover up. More partly. And the Chiefs absorb a loss. Back to the 19. That sets you up on third long now. Now you get mass substitution. Four come in. Four go out. Loss of two setting you up third and seven. Three down and seven. Mahomes dangerous though. On any down. At any distance. 47 percent on third down in the regular season. Second in the NFL. Three receivers left. Kill the inside slot. Kelsey to the right. And from the shotgun. To the back to his right. Mahomes waits on the snap. On third and seven he takes it. Pressure's coming. Mahomes steps up. Throws down the middle. The pass is incomplete. As he sailed one over the head of Sammy Watkins. But will get a flag with a holding call perhaps. The Chiefs will be a quarter of the first down by way of Penalby. Prior to the pass. Holding defense. Number 31. The five yard penalty. Automatic first down. Jonathan Jones on the defensive holding call. So it's 31 on Hill. The ball was thrown not even in Hill's area. So this call was made from center field. We're trying to wait for a replay from CBS here. A referee is Pleet Blakeman who officiated Laster's AFC championship game between the Patriots and the Lakers. The Patriots and Jacksonville. So the football back out to the 24 yard line to split the hash marks. And a fresh set of downs with Williams to the right of Mahomes. Two receivers to the left. Two tight ends right before Kelsey motions left. How does he not have a replay? Mahomes takes the snap. A play fake as he drops back a lot of time. And he lobs a throw deep down the middle. Too long for Sammy Watkins. Trying to lay one out there for him. Crossing midfield with Stefan Gilmer. One of the two Patriots covering. It's a good call on Hill. They finally showed a replay after the snap on first down here. And Hill's trying to fight through Jonathan Jones underneath. So that's a good call. And a second and ten coming up for Kansas City. Although on that play too worth noting the Patriots came with pressure. Blitz Patrick Chung on a third and long. Mahomes in a second and ten. An empty set. Four receivers. An overload to the right. Mahomes is looking left on the slant. The pass is incomplete to Watkins. Gilmer pulls him down after the throw by Mahomes. A sail past. It's a third and ten coming up from the 24. He's trying to get the ball to Watkins. So he's got his pick of the litter here. And he's going against Gilmer. The all-pro defensive back. When you've got Kelsey lined up on J.C. Jackson, a rookie. So you've got a rookie on your all-pro tight end. You're not even peeking at him. Watkins coming off a late season injury. Very productive this season for Kansas City. Though Gilmer held him to two catches in week six. He lines up to the left. Along with Hill. Kelsey motions to the left as well. Mahomes on a third and ten snap. Takes it. Dropping back. Pressure up the middle by VanNoy. Wraps up the quarterback and spins him down. A sack of the eight-yard line. I'll tell you what, Brian Flores. Brian Flores has got himself a set of stones on him. And you wonder why teams are interested in having this guy as a head coach. Rolling the dice. A little game up front with VanNoy outside. And they run a little twist. But more importantly, this doesn't happen unless you lock them up downfield. You're entrusting a rookie to cover an all-pro tight end. And you're negating Watkins. He's got nowhere to go with the ball. And now the 14th-year punter left-footer Dustin Colquitt. Will try to boot it away left to right with Julian Edelman. Waiting on the Patriots side of midfield at the near hash mark. Football spotted at the ten. Nehigh snap. Pressure-free punt. And this one to the far side of the field. With Edelman under it at the 45. On the run right outside to the 45 of Kansas City. And he trots out of bounds in front of Dieter. In coverage for the Chiefs. The Patriots will be set up ideally in Kansas City position. Patriots driving downfield. With a 15-play, 80-yard drive en route to a 7-0 lead. And a one-yard run by Sonya Michelle. And then Kyle VanNoy sacking Patrick Mahomes. On the third and long for a loss of 14. Of course, Dustin Colquitt. The punt out of his end zone. Giving Julian Edelman a chance to return to the Chiefs 44. After the Patriots line up on the right hash. Out of the offset eye with Burikhead behind Devlin. Edelman flanks left. Two tight ends. Allen left. Rob to the right. Brady is under center on a first and ten. As Edelman motions to the right against the Chiefs own. Brady drops back short. And he throws it out to the right side. Too tall. Sailing away from Julian Edelman. Who was open underneath. Kendall Fuller. It's a bad throw. I wonder if Eric Barry got him nervous there. Barry, I think, anticipated what Edelman was going to do. Started to check the coverage. Right before Edelman went in motion. The back guy's off. It slid him over to that side. Brady just airmailed that one to the side. 431 on the clock in this opening quarter play. And again, the Patriots. Beginning their second drive in Chiefs territory. With Gronk and Allen to line up to the left. Burikhead behind Devlin. Hand down the fullback is offset to the right. Edelman is the lone receiver. Split left as Allen sprints in motion. Right to left. Brady dropping back. And he swings it left for Rex Burikhead. Makes the catch on the run to the 45 with a stutter step. Angles left with a stiff arm. And scoots out of bounds. And he's away from Hitchens inside the 40 of Kansas City. To the Chiefs 38 and a half. It's a nice job. Because Hitchens had the leverage. And he got to the sideline the same time that Burikhead did. But he just had a little delay step that allowed him to pick up. Three extra yards. To set up a much more manageable third down. You may be in two down territory. Based on where Gustavsky was having issues with some range. We got a third and fourth coming up for the Patriots. As Burikhead gives way to James White. He lines up to the right of Brady. With a bunch to the right as well. Brock Edelman and Hogan. Doors set. Split to the left. Brady shifts White to his left hip. Points toward a crowded defensive line for Kansas City. Takes the step. Gives it to James White. Runs it up the middle. Finds a crease. And he runs it right to the first down stick. At the 34 yard line. Across the 34. In fact to the 33 and a half. Brought down by Berry. A first down run by James White. Savvy. Great patience following. Joe Tooney pulling left to right. James White takes his left hand. Puts it right on the tail of Tooney. And he said lead me off tackle big boy. And just a little delay. Freezes it. And he cuts up inside. But again. Power running by little number 28. Now the first and tenth of the Patriots. From the right hash of the 34. Out of the eye. Burikhead behind Devlin. Edelman to the left. Gronkowski hand down left. A tight end joined by Allen. Tight to the right. Brady's back under center. When the knee bends. He shifts. Edelman. Widening left. Brady drops back. Gives it to Burikhead. Runs up the middle. Into a crowd. He stood up. And pushed back after a pick up of a couple. Trent Brown got stood up pretty good right there in the hole. I thought this thing was looking good from the get go. The thing that you have here are the three fresh backs. It's White. It's Burikhead. It's Michelle. Xavier Williams was injured on the first drive for the Patriots. Helped to make the stop there. It's a second down and nine officially. Will the Patriots to line up empty. Gronk, Edelman, Hogan. We're here to triangle to the right. Empty. Lives there with two receivers. Dorsett and Patterson left. Now for Earl Patterson. Sprints in motion. Left right. Takes the touch feed from Brady. Sweeping to the right to the 30. To the 25. A cut back of the 20. Off contact. Sarada by defenders and brought down. With a first down shovel pass. On the run left to right to the 18 yard line. Checkers versus chess right now with Josh McDaniels and what he's doing to this defense. They can't keep up. They're guessing. They're trying to substitute. Casey's running four on. They go empty. They bring Patterson in motion. Flip it to him. And he runs 13 yards. Then tips the shoulder. Runs over the safety. Now the first and ten from the 18 out of the eye with Michelle behind Devlin. Tony takes the hand off. Runs up the middle and he carries across the 15. Brought down by Sorensen. That's a rush of four. Right now, again, you're interchanging backs. You're keeping the legs fresh. And you're wearing down a defensive front that really, really, really isn't good against the run. The Patriots with their second series of the night already out to a seven nothing lead. Now in the huddle to break with a game clock on the move under a minute and a half to go here in this first quarter. Devlin will line up to the left of Michelle. With the football placed down on the right hash mark with the cheese for a team. Edelman split right. Two tight ends. Book ends. Allen left. Gronkowski right. Brady pulls away. A give to Michelle. Runs behind Devlin right. And Sonya Michelle driving forward. Carries it to the ten. Tough running by the back. Eric Berry makes the stop. But the Patriots have a third and short from the Kansas City ten. That might be his best run of the night so far. It's a delay. Connor to the back side. But again, it's the patience of 26 to trust where the fullback's going. Wait for the guard to pull. And then drop your shoulder. What he's doing, Bob, he's dropping his shoulder. Something he wasn't doing earlier in the year. It's a third down and two for the Patriots. From the right hash of the ten is Gronkowski. Flexes right. Three receivers spread out wide to the left door. Hogan. Edelman. Outside in. Right to the left. Surveys the defense. Motions Edelman right. Followed by Ward the rookie. Brady takes the snap. Backs up. Throws it right for Edelman. Makes the catch of the stick. And dives to the far side of the five. It's a first and goal to go. Cash. Money throw by the quarterback. Where are you going? You're going to your guy. They bring him in motion. And you talk about defensive backs. You know, eleven's getting the ball on third and two. And yet you give them a six yard cushion on a speed out. Money throw. Quarter's gone. Kansas City hasn't even sniffed the football. Seven nothing Patriots knocking on the door with a first and goal to go. When the second quarter begins in Kansas City as we pause ten seconds for a station ID on the safety insurance. Ninety five the sports up Patriots radio network. He dives at the one. Good patience by Michelle. Waiting for the opening to develop. Second and goal to go. Coming up for the pass. It is. Reverse out. Bring your guard. Boom. Brewer's your fullback. Boom. Two big blocks and you get twenty six right between them. They can't stop it. They got it. They don't have an answer for it. Football placed down on the left hash of the one after the four yard carry. Leidried Waddle an extra tackle in the huddle for the Patriots. And the Winglin trying to extend the lead to work out of the eye with Devlin to put a hand down in front of Michelle. An overload right before Allen motions to the left to join Gronkowski there. Brady under center gives to Michelle. Runs left behind Devlin and the G-Fool engulf him. A swarm over the ball carrier stops short. It'll be a third and goal to go. It's a good push. Good push by the Chief. Stay with it. Stay with it. Continue to two o'clock. Run the football. You got an element of toughness in you here on the road. It's just hard to fire out as an offensive line there when you can't hear. Patriots to our right. Break the huddle. Ball down. Left hash of the one. Gronkowski to the left. Waddle and Allen to the right. Again from the eye. Devlin in front of Michelle. Play fake by Brady. He threw to the end zone. Intercepted to the end zone. Picked off and running it right. Reggie Ragland. Takes the knee in the end zone. Brady off the play fake. Tried to feather a pass. It appeared to Gronkowski. And he throws the interception. It's a killer. Time out and a 7-0 lead for the Pats early on the second on the same team. The end zone by Reggie Ragland on the third and goal to go from the one. Gives the chief possession of the 20. Shotgun snapped him a home. Down 7-0. He's chased from the pocket. Rolling right. Pursued by Van Noy. And Simon throws to the right incomplete with Travis Kelsey crossing left to right. Trailed by J.C. Jackson. It's a great effort by Simon and Van Noy to push him. But more importantly, don't allow him to get around the edge and get the shoulder square and attack it. He's continuing to fall back. That's when you become inaccurate. Brady had 237 passes. Yep. Without an interception prior to that. So he's protecting the football really well. I think it slipped. I think he was trying to float it out over the two defenders. And instead the ball may have slipped out of his hand. Hitchens intercepted. Snapped him a home to the play fake. Starts to roll right. Sets up a screen right in the flat for Kelsey. Turns upfield to the 25. And he is upended. Jonathan Jones coming up to make the tackle. Kelsey goes. Heddeberry heels. Plummeting at the 29. It'll be a third down and one for Kansas City. They're going to make a play or two like that. I mean, defense can only do so much. Eventually they're going to start to make some plays. They're going to settle down a little bit. Get the young kid some throws that he can hit. Right there it's Kelsey out in the flat on a quick flip. But a golden opportunity missed by the Pats. And now with Mahomes up under center. Williams in the backfield. His heel sprints to the backfield as well. Lines up at the tailback. Gets a give to Damian Williams. Runs it left. And he's stuffed. Williams may have gotten the forward progress. No. To the 29 and a half. But he is still a half yard short. And he's not going to go for it. There's no way. Good job by Malcolm Brown in the middle defensively. Now the Chiefs did convert 12 of 15 fourth down tries during the regular season. Oh defense. Way to go baby. Now here's the key. You got to get your putt safe out there. You got to play defense here. Not worry about a return. Colquitt to our right. The left footed veteran. That's a full yard. His father and his brother have Super Bowl experience. Try to get there for the Chiefs. With Edelman to our left inside the 25. Don't jump off side. The snap. Waist high. Left footed punt. Sails toward Edelman. Backing him up. Inside the 15. Julian from the left hand. Runs to the 20 yard line. Gets a block to spring outside to the far boundary. Chased out of bounds across the 25 at the 27. Pursued by Eric Murray. That's a 58 yard punt by Colquitt with the wind at his back. Gets a 7-0 lead for the Patriots early in the second. On the safety insurance. 98-5. The sports of Patriots. Radio Network. So the Patriots just a short runaway it appeared. But they threw it on a third and goal to go from the one. Intercepted by Kansas City. Squandering a chance to increase a 7-0 lead. But the defense gets a three and out. And now the Pats go left to right from their 26 early in the second. Still on top by touchdown. A give out of the eye. Desoni-Michelle side steps a tackler with a cut left. He's brought down by Xavier Williams with a gain of three. Out to the 29. Yeah, a little bit of a delay there. Gets caught up inside. Right behind Andrews. And he tries to hop from right to left. Still picks up. That's three. Michelle gives way for the Pats to the far side line. Ball plays down in the left hash as New England goes left to right. Hogan and Edelman will split left for the Patriots. Gronkowski's going to line up right. Offside eye. Devlin with full back hand down. In front of Berkut. Hogan motions to the right. Against the man coverage. He draws fullers. Brady drops back, looking to throw. Stands in, fires to the right. And it's going to be intercepted. No! He tried to find Gronkowski crossing left to right. And the deep safety, Eric Perry, nearly had an interception in midfield. I think it was Jones coming around, Trent Brown, where Brady felt a little bit of that. And he rushed the throw to Gronkowski. But it's the left side pressure. This crowd in Kansas City. Ball's high. Amped up with the Patriots, five for six on third down. But now facing a third down and seven from New England's 29. Three receivers to the left. White to the left of Brady. Here comes Hogan in motion left to right. Brady stands in the gun. Gronkowski to the tight end right. A four man watch as Brady is pressured. He moves up. He throws it out to the left. Back shorter. What a catch! Adjusting James White. Makes the play under the defender, Eric Murray. At the 38 yard line. I've seen that. I've seen it all now, man. The footwork of Brady in the pocket. The pocket collapses. They hold it at first. Then it starts to condense around him. He slides up. He's getting hit. He finds James White. Flips it out to where only James can see it. To the back right hip. And it's a nine yard pick up for first. What a throw catch. And a first and ten for the Patriots from the left hash of the 38. Back to the eye. Burkett behind Devlin. Had him in the long split to the right. Burkett will now sprint in motion to the right as well. Brady drops back. Five step stands and throws across the middle. Wide open Gronkowski. Rumbles to the 45. And he's upended. Shoulder down. Close to the first down marker. He'll be spotted at the 47 yard line with a tackle by Fuller. Interesting. We haven't seen that formation all year where they leave Devlin as a long back. Motion. Burkett all the way out. And it's nice they did. It's a quick pop to Gronk. But it's a block by Burkett from the outside in that allows Gronkowski to pick up an extra three yards. So the second down and one from the 47. Rob Gronkowski with his third catch of the day. But it was that target in the end zone that led to an interception from the one. Two receivers left. Hogan in the slot. Dorsett on the outside. Edelman the flanker right outside of Gronk. The single back is Michelle. Brady under center. Takes the snap. Turns. Gives to Michelle. Runs up the middle. It's only Michelle with the lean has the forward progress in her first down. A little rush across the 48. Kansas City thinks they've stopped them. They've got the first down. They don't even know it's a first down. Just keep chewing clock. Slow methodical drives. Patriots the only thing that can stop them themselves. You can blame the call. You can blame the throw. You can blame them both. Just the big thing is you've got to put that behind you. And it looks like they did to start this drive. They've got a big pick way up from the defense. Now with Edelman the slot left inside of Hogan. Patterson is on the left wing for the Pats. Right the single back. First and ten from the 49. Edelman in motion with Brady. Play fake to Michelle. And he screens it underneath his brother James White. And he drops it. White. It's hard. It's surrounded by the Chiefs. It's hard to execute a quick screen like that. When it's motion across. Clear him. Fake this. Parallel. Get my shoulder square. Find the back. Don't throw a pick. It's too much to get at the three yards in front of you. Now second down and ten for New England ball in the Kansas City Arrowhead logo. At midfield. Seven nothing Patriots. At the 907 mark here in the second. Edelman the flank and right to receivers left. Patterson on the outside of Hogan. Michelle the single back. From the Patriots 49. Brady. Fakes a screen left. Hands it off to Michelle. Keeping hold. Runs up the middle to the 45. And Sony is tackled by two defenders. Including Raglin. The linebacker at the interception to stop him from gaining a first down as he picks up nine. You gotta batter this one in here. You gotta pick this one up. You know if he could have just ducked his shoulder at the tippy top of this. Find the safety and hit your head off it. Third down and one for the Pats from the 42 of Kansas City. Back to the eye with Michelle. Upon the backside of Devlin. The fullback puts the hand down. Hook end cut ends. Brady under center. Takes the snap. Gives to Michelle. Runs it left side. And Sony Michelle is hit behind the line. It could not lunge back to the inside. The Chiefs take him down for a loss of one. Brady's ticked. He went to cleat Blakeman here. Because the not cleat. But it was the referee that held the ball to allow them to substitute. He wanted the quick snap. But they held it on him. They're going for it. The Patriots huddle the pun team. For the offense to stay out on the field. The football at the 42 and a half of Kansas City. Brady's under center. It's fourth and a yard and a half. And now the offense will trot to the far side. Kansas City may have to burn a timeout. I don't know what's going on. Will come on with Tyree Kill. Shuffling back as the return man for the Chiefs. Seven nothing Patriot leads. Stop it. Oh that's ridiculous. The Chiefs had a 12th man who just got to the sideline with a snap to Allen Way's tie. And Ryan puns it away left to right. A delay of game on New England. Delay of game. Offense. By George Renly. Let's look at it. No. This can't be delay of game. The referee held the ball. They held the snap. This crew has no clue what they're doing right now. The referee is up at the center holding the snap. He's holding the call. Well you have to give the other team an opportunity. If you substitute. Offense mass substitution. You can't step in that way. I understand on substitution after a play. That's mid play. Here we go again. And now with Ryan Allen back to return. Is he in. Allen on the play. Throwing Allen at him. Good. Inside the 42 hour left. And you're right. The official now holding up play waiting for Blakeman to line the clock from 7.45 and counting him a seven nothing Patriot lead. Cardona snaps it back. Allen field left footed punt under some duress. He's going to carry with a fair catch called for by Hill to the far side of the 14 yard line. Matthew Slater bearing down on Tyree Gill. Midway through the second quarter in the AFC championship. Seven nothing lead for the Patriots. But they have dominated this game thus far. They squandered a chance on a third and goal to go from the KC one to add to the lead with an interception of the end zone. Now the Holmes goes to work with Williams the back to his left. Three receivers left. The Gelsie the tight end flexed wide against the rookie Jackson. The Holmes takes the snap of the gun gives it to Damian Williams stretching to the right. Turns it back to the inside stumbles a bit and he has dropped at the 20 yard line. Tackle made by Laurence Guy but that's a pick up of five for Damian Williams. Again it's bump and run man. Patriots doing a lot of man to start this football game. A lot of time left. Getting around the seven minute mark here but demanding up the rookie on an all pro tight end eventually. You know they're going to wake up and try and take advantage of that. Go after him a little bit. Devin McCord did the deep safety for the Patriots with the second down and forward coming up. Robinson to the right two receivers left. Hill on the slot Connelly on the outside. Williams just to the right wing with Gelsie on the left wing. Tyree Kill motions left right a play fake to him and then a shovel underneath to Gelsie. Wrapped up immediately good play by Kyle Van Noy. Diagnosing and taking him down. Gelsie able to fall forward for two but it's a third and two for Kansas City from its 23. Yeah Van Noy having himself a game right now reading and reacting. Yeah taking advantage if he sees something he's attacking instead of sitting and waiting for it to come to him. We had a big sack on the Chiefs first possession for a loss of 14 on a third and long. Now it's a third and two ball on the right hash of the 23. Gelsie started to the right and comes back to the left to line up outside of a bunch formation. Robinson sprints left to right. Mahomes now motions Watkins left to right. Got a moving part for the Chiefs with a bunch down to his right. Here goes Tyree Kill in motion play fake by Mahomes. Scrambles left being pressured Mahomes trying to get outside. Wrapped up throws to the open receiver at the 35 yard line near side. Breaking it down for Kansas City Sammy Watkins. So Patrick Mahomes had to help their scouter back there but that's what he does. Able to maneuver and find an open receiver coming back to the football for a first down completion to the 35. It's all Mahomes because a perfect job by the Patriots. They tried to bang the slant backside to Gelsie. A ton of overloaded stuff. Van Doy can. Now first down and 10 for the Chiefs on the 35 going right to left. Two receivers making three now to the right with one receiver left. Amian Williams to the right of Mahomes from the gun. Takes the snap play fake. Dropping back has time. Steps up wears back fires down the right side. Hill is open makes the catch at the 25. Tyree Kill is tackled there as he got away. From Keyon Croson the rookie. Kevin McCordy. Got to get set again. Get back. Get your head. Get your head on a swivel. Croson a rookie. Get back into it too. You've controlled this entire game. Seventh round pick and the Chiefs who hit on 52 plays of 25 yards or longer during the regular season including 22 completions to Tyree Kill pick up 42. That's where that RPO, that option comes into play here off the fake. And now a first in 10 for Kansas City from the Patriots 23 yard line with trips to the left. Hill the slot receiver between Robinson and Mlodzkin. Shotgun snapped on Mahomes. Dropping back. Amian Williams is wide open down the right side of the real route. And Mahomes missed him. He overthrew the running back with Kyle Van Noy trying to recover for the Patriots. Wow did you have a pick out there too. Now I don't know if this was within range where the pick is legal. But you had a pick by Kelsey on Van Noy. Didn't have a chance. And Mahomes airmails it. Kelsey had thrown his hands in the air after setting that screen signaling a touchdown. But Mahomes with the air and throw. He had a few of those in the first meeting of these teams. Now it's second in 10 for Kansas City. 437 to go on the second and a 7-0 Patriot lead. Two receivers stacked left. Williams to the left of Mahomes. Two tight ends stacked to the right. Takes the snap. Hand off to Amian Williams. Runs to the right. Slips the hit by Flowers. But then he runs into Lawrence Guy and there's no movement there. It's a minimal gain. It'll be third and long. It's a good way to swallow him up inside. They can't let them get that thing going right there. And after a big play you got to get back and settle back down and try and get off the field holding the three here. They're down in nine Mahomes with 50 touchdown passes. More than 5,000 yards for the third most prolific offense in NFL history. Kelsey Watkins in the hill will form a triangle bunch to the left. Meanwhile, one receiver to the right. Ware the back to the right of Mahomes who takes the snap. On third down in nine. Dropping back. Scrambling away from the pocket. He's tripped up and he's dropped back at the 37 yard line. No field goal. Trey Flowers in pursuit with Van Neu, Claiborne and Hightower. Way to go boys. Way to push that pocket. Terrible, terrible decision by the quarterback to not sense pressure. Again, this is where he gets into trouble. He could keep plays alive, but he just took his team out of field goal range. And again, so he had a running back who was wide open to the right. Mahomes circled back to his left. Jailbreak. Man, what a job by the defense. With that loss of 14, it forces the Chiefs to bring on Colquitt to punt. He stands in midfield. He fields a knee-high snap. He puts the nose of the football down. He punts it high, short, end over end to Edelman who catches on the number 10 on the far side of the field. 3.08 to go in the second quarter. The Patriots backed up with their 10 with a 7-0 lead over Kansas City from the offside eye with Devlin in front of Michele. Groff motions to the right. Brady's under center. Hands it off to Sonya Michele. Runs up the middle. Hit by Jones behind Alon. And then stood up after a two-yard rush to the 12. Hitchens with the tackle. Little extra contact well after the whistles had sounded. And the forward progress had been stopped. Wow. Let them play there. I mean, progress has stopped. He takes it back three yards and then body slams it. I think he'd get a flag next time. Really can't ask for a better start defensively, including a three-and-out after the Patriots turn the ball over with an interception in the end zone. On a third and goal to go from the one. Now with a second down to eight, Brady gives it to Michele, runs left side, slices across the line and carries for a first down beyond the 20. Dropped at the 21-yard line. Tackle made by Berry. I love that first down run by Michele. Love the call on second down because it's a run. They snap that with 226 on the clock. They're going to bleed this baby down to the two-minute. Nice job, Josh. More importantly, great job blocking up front. It's allowing Michele to go untouched up to the safety. That's a big boy run right there. Chiefs won the coin toss, deferred to take the kickoff to start the second half. We're in the two-minute warning. Three time-outs a piece and a seven-nothing lead for the Pats. Here on the second on the safety insurance 98.5, the Sports Hub Patriots. Radio Network. Out of the two-minute warning in the second, seven-nothing Patriots with the first and 10 coming up. From the New England 21. From the off-set eye going left to right. Devlin with full back with Michele with the tail back. Edelman comes in motion left to right. Play fake to him. A pitch left for Sonya Michele. Trying to get outside strung out by Berry who collars him down and takes him to the turf. With a gain of one. It's a really good play by Eric Berry. If he's not there, Michele's going to get around the edge kind of. I think it's Houston to that side. Chiefs still have all three time-outs remaining. They do not take one here. Kansas City won the coin toss and deferred. Accepting the kickoff of the second half. He snapped that at the two-minute mark. That's a good job by Michele. Not getting in contact and going to the sideline. The seven-nothing Patriots lead. New England breaks from the huddle. Andrews over the football at the 22. Michele back to the off-set eye. With the tail back behind Devlin. Rod motions left to right. Brady under center. Pulls away. Gives to Michele. Runs it to the right side. It's on to Michele. Carries to the 27. Driven back by Sorensen. Brady really had to extend and reach out to make the handoff. And now Andy Reid takes the time-out with 1.11 to go in the half. He can't take him with him. He'll eventually take the time-out. He's let a lot of time go off that clock. I would have taken one at 1.50. Kansas City takes its first time-out. At least one minute, 13 seconds. On the game clock, 1.13. First time was snapped at two minutes. At this point with 1.13 to go in the second quarter, Sonya Michele has the lone touchdown. It's a 7-0 lead for the Pats. Who face a third and four after the Chiefs spent their first time-out. The Patriots really should be working with a two-score differential. They had a third and goal to go from the one before Tom Brady was intercepted in the end zone by Anthony Hitchens, rather Reggie Ragland. And now with a third down and four coming up. From the 27 ball on the right hash. With James White to the right of Brady. Dorsett and Hogan White. Edelman's lot left. Rock flexed out to the wide side left. Hitchens shows blitz and then retreats. Brady sends Hogan in motion. White to left against the man coverage. Takes the snap. Dropping back. Throws it to the right. James White makes a twisting catch behind him for a first-down dive. Out to the 32 as Sorensen comes over. But White uncovered out of the backfield. And for the second time today he's able to contort on a throw behind him below his waist with an outstanding play. You said it best. I don't know what more 28 can do. And now the Patriots in a hurry up. Shotgun snap to Brady. Dropping back. Screens it right for White. Clears the blockers and runs to the 40. Out of a tackle, 45-50. James White to Kansas City, 45. Still driving defenders across the 40. Tackled by Fuller at the 38-yard line. With 41 seconds to go. And a timeout by New England. That's what more he can do right there. But what about the play call? You think, okay, they just picked it up. New England takes its first time out of the half. Let's talk about this real quick. So this is the coaching mismatch right here. Checkers versus Chess. You just hit him on a great catch by White. You think he's walking back to the huddle. What are they going to do? Probably just hand it off and burn clock. No, McDaniels comes right back, same side. Quick screen to White. And it's a bang bang. He steps out of the first guy, gets up to that second level. He's almost off to the races. That's a 30-yard catch and run by James White. With that first down, Credit Union's Kids at Heart donates to the Team Jack Foundation up to $30,000 to fight pediatric brain cancer and fund clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. To learn more, visit CUCidsatHeart.org. The pads have it at the Chiefs. 38-yard line. Going in this direction, left to right at Arrowhead. Not favorable for the plays kickers based on what we saw on the warm-ups. Real quick, James White had some issues in that previous drive. A little nicked up, went to the sideline to see the grimace. Didn't receive much medical attention, but something to keep an eye on. But he looked pretty good right there. James White coming off a 15-catch performance against the Chargers, tying Darren Sproles for the most receptions in the postseason by a running back as the second game of 14-plus catches in his career in the postseason. And of course the first in Super Bowl LI. Now with a trip to Super Bowl LII on the line and a chance to play the Rams in two weeks in Atlanta. The Pads with a 7-0 lead. 41 seconds and two timeouts with which to work here in the second quarter. Down the football on the right hash, the near hash of the Chiefs. 38-yard line. Offensive line. Now, knocking on wood here has been really, really good up to this point. Pinpoint. What a job by Scarneckia. There has been no toning it down. The volume at full decibels by this Kansas City crowd. Too cold to sit down. The seats are all plastic. The Patriots have handled it well thus far. Again, as a team that lost five road games during the regular season. It's still a long way to go. With New England guilty of the game's lone turnover to this point. Again, it's the guys that haven't really been looked at yet. A Dorsett or a Hogan that could come up massive at a spot like this on this type of drive. Patriots break from a huddle and Brady will stand on the gun with white to his right. Three receivers to the short side. Right cross to the left as the quarterback pulls up at play. You can see the steam from his breath. Identifying the defender in the middle to set the protections. Takes the snap. Gives it to James White. Running to the left. Gets outside of Andrews to the 35-30. And James White carries it to the 29-yard line. Lassoed from behind by Anthony Hitchens. Time out New England with 33 seconds to go. I said get outside. I saw it developing. And they have a center to deal with noise. To deal with setting the call. And to get his big butt outside to the left. And have the block that sets this thing free. David Andrews is a stud. He's having himself one hell of a game right here. Nine-yard pick up around left end. Kansas City has no answer defensively as of yet. Andrews the fourth year. Undrafted free agent out of Georgia. Trying to go back home to Atlanta. With 33 seconds left. Here in the second quarter the Patriots with one timeout remaining. Trying to expand. A seven-nothing lead. Ball on the far hash of the 29. Brady from the gun with two receivers left. Two right including Grant. White in the back. Short motion by Edelman left. Brady takes the snap. Back three steps. He pumps. He looks long. He throws it down the left side for Dorsett. And he makes the catch in the end zone. Touchdown. Patriots. What did I just tell you? You forget about him. And that's what this team's about. My God. The double pump by Brady. To have the cojones. The stones to sit in the pocket. Calmly give the pump. And it's a pump and go. 29-yard dagger. With 27 ticks left in the first half. And the AFC Championship. Forget about him. He catches anything you throw in his direction. I know officially last week he was credited. With a target that went for an incompletion. That's really 20 straight targets that he's caught. Including the touchdown for 29. Gostkowski for the point after. Snap and plays. Kick airborne to the uprights. The kick is good. The Patriots squatted an early chance to build on the lead. But they strike first. And they strike at the 27th second mark here in the second quarter. With a 14-0 lead in this AFC Championship game. And Arrowhead. Should be a 21-zip smoke show right now. Wow. What a call. Oh, Josh McDaniels had him a week. The focus, the attention to detail. And being around the team a little bit. And you hear the whispers. And you're with them here for a day or two. And you talk to them. Focus was the big word all week. An interior calmness and a focus. And an anxiousness. Yeah, you got nerves. You got nerves. Everybody's got nerves. You got nerves. I got nerves. If you don't have nerves as a player in a game like this. You're not doing the right job. Let's talk about the complimentary football. First series for Kansas City. 14-yard sack by Kyle Van Noy. The last series for the Chiefs. They were in position to score. They struck on a long gainer to Tyreek Hill. But eventually were forced out of field goal range. Because of a sack for another lawsuit 14. The Patriots drive it 90 yards. 8 plays, 241. White plays a big role. Dorsett, his former high school teammate in South Florida. Capsin. Kickoff by Gostkowski. Bouncing it down the turf. Across the 35 to the 25. It's handled there by Harris. The up man runs to the left. He's going to try to turn the corner outside of the 35. Takes to the sideline across the 40. And that gives the Chiefs good field position. With 21 seconds to go here in the second quarter. Trailing 14-nothing with the quarterback. To get the football to the end zone from his 20. Let alone outside his 40. I don't understand the squib. Why aren't you kicking it away. And kicking it to the goal line. I mean, you know it's going to be returned. So you give it to him at the 25 or the 20. And you take time off the clock. The squib kick has never really worked for me. I've been in these situations, you know, we were in college and pros. And they always blow up in your face. I've never been in any of those situations. And I'm not a fan either. Trips to the right, including Kelsey on the wing. One receiver left. Shepkin's now to Mahomes. Drops back with a pump. Chase by Vandora. He hits it. The ball's loose. And Mahomes is going to cover up on it. At the 26 yard line. You got this kid swastered. The clock at 10 and 9. It continues to count down. And Andy Reid will not take a timeout. The Patriots are going to head to the locker room. At halftime of the AFC championship. And Kyle Van Noy is having himself a night. Trying to make it three for three as a Patriot. But a half. He's gone to two Super Bowls thus far. And again, 14-0 New England here at Arrowhead. At halftime of this AFC title contest. Mark Bertrand has the first half analysis. And a look around the NFL on the Rockland Federal Credit Union. A halftime show including the controversial end to regulation in New Orleans. Coming up next. Welcome back to our Town Fair Tire Studios at 98.5. The sports hub Kansas City won the toss and deferred tonight. Giving the Patriots the football to start the game. Tom Brady and the Off Eds were dominant out of the gate. The Pats converted on three-third downs on the drive. And used up more than eight minutes of clock on their way to the end zone. Out of the eye with Devlin the full back for Michelle. Short motion by Allen left with a reset. The gift to Michelle runs it left into the end zone. Touchdown Patriots. New England strikes first. 15 plays 80 yards and it was 7-0 New England. And on the first Chiefs drive Patriots linebacker Kyle Van Noy got to Patrick Mahomes for a third down sack. Which led to a punt and the Patriots started their next drive in KC territory. Brady and Company were on the doorstep again. Third and goal from the one when this happened. Play fake by Brady. Throw to the end zone. Intercepted into the end zone. Picked off and running it right. Reggie Raglin takes the knee in the end zone. Brady off the play fake. Tried to feather a pass. It appeared to Gronkowski. Chiefs couldn't capitalize on that turnover going three and out before the Patriots punted for the first time in the game. And it was on the ensuing drive that the home team threatened to score. But the Patriots defense stepped up on third and nine at the 22. Third down and nine. Dropping back. Scrambling away from the pocket. He's tripped up and he's dropped back at the 37 yard line. No field goal. Trey Flowers in pursuit with Van Nooy, Claiborne and Hightower. And as you heard Zosay, that sack dropped KC out of field goal range. They were forced to punt, giving the Patriots the ball back with just over three minutes to go in the half. And that was too much time to leave TB12. Brady takes the snap. Back three steps. He pumps. He looks long. He throws it down the left side for Doris Satt. And he makes the catch in the end zone. Touchdown. Patriots. Eight plays, 90 yards. Just two minutes and 41 seconds. 14-0 Patriots to score. And that is where we stand at halftime of the AFC title game. Patriots with a two touchdown lead. We'll recap what happened in the NFC after this. Late in the fourth quarter of today's NFC championship game, the only controversial matter was that the Rams had decided to kick a field goal. Just over five minutes to go and regulation to tie it at 20. LA coach Sean McVeigh had decided to kick that field goal instead of going forward on fourth down from the Saints one yard line. It meant Drew Brees would have over five minutes to drive the field and win the game. And he tried to do just that. And then on a third down play from the Rams 13 yard line, Brees was looking for receiver Tommy Lee Lewis. Third down and ten. Brees from the gun. Takes the snap. Goes to the near side. Hit early. Where's the flag? You don't get one. Early hit on Tommy Lee. Shot pain is all the way down at the ten. Unbelievable. No call. Wow. Not a flag to be found. Not a flag on that play. It appeared to be a clear pass interference type of play. It also was helmet to helmet contact. Sean Payton said at his press conference after the game that the league admitted to him privately that he was right and that it could have been either of those two calls. This game would go to overtime and Drew Brees would have a chance to win it again. He had the football, but he threw a pick and then the Rams would have a chance to win it on a field goal. 103 decibels and they're just getting started as Zerline sets up for a 57 yard try to win the NFC championship game. The hold is down. The kick clears the line and Greg Zerline sends the Rams to the Super Bowl. LA will play for the Lombardi. And that kick was a no doubter would have been good from 60 plus right down the middle. The Lombardi sends the Rams to the Super Bowl two weeks from tonight in Atlanta who they will face to be determined here in the second half. It's a 14 nothing Patriots lead over the Chiefs in the AFC title game here on the Safety Insurance 98 5 the Sports Hub Patriots Radio Network. Welcome back to the AFC championship here at Arrowhead Stadium Patriots lead the Chiefs 14 to nothing. Time of possession New England 21 0 7 Chiefs 8 53. Chiefs with 32 total yards to end the half set the scene here for the second half. Chiefs won the opening coin toss. It did defer, which means they will receive. Here's Bob Sose. Earlier today, the Rams is the number two seed went to New Orleans, as you know, and won it over time over the Saints. The Patriots have a 14 nothing lead. Here is the number two seed in Kansas City trying to end a streak of three straight losses in road AFC championship games. But they've been here before against the Chiefs. It was 21 9 and halftime back in week six. Kansas City eventually took the lead before the Patriots battled back to win it late. Goscowski field goal 43 40. Last year, the Pats had a big lead over Kansas City, but were outscored 21 nothing in the fourth quarter. Now Goscowski tees it up to our right of the 35 and swings the leg to drive the kick for Traymon Smith. Come on outside fielding from the one carries to the five to the 10 outside of the 15 to the 20. Smith runs it outside the 25 brought down there by the Edner and company. The Chiefs will go left to right. Patrick Mahomes struggling in that opening half of play for four for eight. Sixty five yards sacked three times as good as this defense has been all night. This is a critical series here. You can't let them get back into this game with the quick strike capability that they have to get a quick seven on the board changes the complexion of everything. One catch for Hill, 42 yards, two catches for Kelsey for 11. And now with Mahomes in the gun, Williams to his left, two receivers to the right, Kelsey on the left wing. Going left to right from the 26. Shotgun snaps, Humahomes dropping back screens at left. Catch by Damian Williams turns up good and Kyle Van Noy makes a terrific play. Warning off the blocker and wrapping up Williams to bring him to the far side line at the 31 yard line. Van Noy is pinned by two blockers, two guys have him. He splits him, gets through and gets to Williams. Wow, what a play by Van Noy. That is a five yard gain. Kyle Van Noy was engaged with Mitch Morse, the veteran center for the Chiefs. Again, able to shield him off and make the play on Williams who stands behind Mahomes, deepest of the setback. Three and a bunch to the right. Mahomes with a give. Williams runs it up the middle, last on at the line, Trey Flowers brings him down. He'll pick up three to the 34 yard line. And of course the Chiefs into a third down and two. Even the third shorts. I know third two, third three may be a little more doable for them, but it gets them thinking, we have a converter, we got to convert again. You're trying to convert instead of picking up first downs on first and second down. She's taking her time here. Chiefs one for four on third down in the opening half and now it's a third and two from the 34. Ball splits to hash marks, two receivers to the right. Kelsey to the left as Mahomes drops back with a lot of time. Spine. Spine. Stands in the pocket, starts to roll to his right, throws on the go, deep downfield for Sammy Watkins who makes the catch behind Gilmore. And he's tripped up, falling at the 11 yard line. Make it the 12. It's one of the best throws I've seen all year. They spine. Watkins gets behind Gilmore. Gilmore knows it's coming. And the kid just puts enough air on it, scrambles up, it's only a three man rush. And it's a 54 yard dime right down the gut. This is exactly what I'm talking about. See how quick they get back in these games. Two former Bills teammates matched up in week six at it again. Watkins with the upper hand there. And a first and ten for the Chiefs from the 12. Williams to the right of Mahomes, two receivers left. Kelsey split to the right against J.C. Jackson. Mahomes takes the snap, dropping back, stands in, fires down the middle. Kelsey makes the catch, touchdown Kansas City. The arms of J.C. Jackson slams the football to the turf and the Chiefs are on the board. They're opening possession of the third quarter. Way, way, way too easy. Third two, it's an easy convertible one. He could have ran it, but he elected to throw it. It's a 54 yard strike, which sets it up. It's just an easy looking bang route from the right side on Kelsey. It's not a great route. It's just a bigger guy. They had a little push at the top of it, but all pros, they get away with that. It's 12 yard touchdown. Mahomes with a lot of time on that 54 yarder on the third and short. And again, rolling right, firing the strike down the middle. Now, Buckner off to the point after try. Winchester will snap it back to Colquitt through the haze of the fireworks smoke. And the kick is airborne to the uprights. But the kick is good, so the Chiefs have the deficit. We've got a ball game early in the third of the AFC Championship. 12.56 on the clock, 14.7 New England. 99 yards for the Patriots in the opening half of play on the ground, but it's Kansas City. It strikes with a 54 yard pass from Mahomes to Watkins on third and two, setting up a 12 yard touchdown strike from Mahomes to Kelsey. To complete a four play, 74 yard drive in 2.04. Not that we needed to remodour how quickly the Chiefs can strike. 14.7, Patriots early in the third. And the kickoff by Buckner, sails left to right for Quidero Patterson. It'll be a touchback as it lands behind him five yards into the end zone. Okay, gotta keep doing what you did on offense in that first half. Don't get complacent, don't take your foot off the gas. The defense learned from what you didn't do that you did in the first half where it was pressure. You let this kid Mahomes turn a corner and set his feet. He can make every throw. So Brady and Coveney go back to work with the ball placed down on the right hash mark of the 25 going right to left in the road white jerseys with the Navy blue numerals in the Navy blue pants, red and silver piping, silver helmets. Chiefs in their home white jerseys with, or their home red jerseys with the white pants, red helmets. Of course the gold piping, Adam in motion right to left with Burkhead to start a tailback as Brady drops back looking to throw. He screens it right for Burkhead, reaches up and makes the catch on the run. And he's shoved out of bounds, tightrope in the far sideline. Good play by Burkhead to extend. Reggie Ragland forces him out after a gain of five. I never saw that formation either. I mean you got James White lined up as the fullback, offset to the weak side. And it's Burkhead on a little flare to the right. That's a good first down pickup. Second and five for the Patriots. The ball plays down again on the far hash, right hash. Kronkowski will be the tight end right. Allen lines up the book end tight end left. Edmund the flanker left. Offset eye Devlin to the left of Michelle. Edmund moves in motion left to right. Brady's under center. Second down and five. Takes the snap. Dropping back. Throwing it to Edmund. Ali out. Makes the catch. And Fuller shoves him out of bounds. Short of the first down marker. Julian with the grab at the 34 yard line. It'll be a third and one. Gotta get the push now. Critical. Critical you respond to Stryve. Need to chew clock. Continue to push the sticks. Even if you don't get points. Converting on consecutive possessions. It's been big for you in this game. Out of the huddle. Emerge Hogan to the left. Edmund lines up tight to the left of Kronkowski. Tight end right. Brady drops back. Hands it off to Burkhead. Tripped up behind the line. But he dives forward with the first down. He's able to break the 35. With the nose of the football across the line to make. First in ten New England. It's a great individual effort by Burkhead. Because I'm telling you it's hard to come off on a snap. If you can't hear the snap count. Because everything is based on movement. He gets hit in the backfield. He elevates. Stretches out. And gets it over that 35 yard line for the first down. Burkhead to the sideline for the Patriots. And replaced by Sonya Michelle. Patterson. A line. Behind Kronkowski to the right. Patterson in the backfield. Now comes in motion left. Brady on first in ten. Play fix to Michelle. Throws down a little. Too tall for Kronkowski. And behind him as well. You had Hogan as. Another receiver streaking deep down the left side. Eventually getting clear. But Brady off the mark. In search of the big tight end. Yeah this is a tough one here. Because they're dropping out from underneath. And he's going to get in trouble again. It's almost throws it directly to Hitchens. Run directly to Ragland. Trying to find Kronkowski in the end zone early. With a 7-0 lead. That's one of the opportunities. To extend the lead. Man. Certainly looming large. It's a 14-7 advantage for the bats. Second in ten from the 35. Michelle the single back. Brady pumps to the left. Hands it to Michelle. Breaks a tackle in the backfield. Runs it right. And he's brought down at the 39 yard line. Sonya Michelle. Able to run away from Daniel Sorenson. Who had the penetration. Justin Houston eventually makes the stop. Patriots confront a third down and long. You know oddly. Did the defense lose track of the downs? They all put their hands up in a fist. Like it was fourth down after the tackle. Three tacklers around the ball. It's a third and six right now. The ball out to the 39 yard line. Right hash. Kronkowski the tight end right. Edelman. Hogan. Dorsett. Aligned to the left. White to the right of Brady. The quarterback in the gun. Sends Edelman in motion. Left to right. Draws the coverage by Ward. Shotgun snapped to Brady. Back to throw. And the pass across the middle is knocked out of the line. Chris Jones. Reeking havoc last week with Indianapolis. Apparently gets a hand on the football there. Looked like it was Jones who blocked that pass from Brady. The Patriots will have to punt. And I still think Barry would have gotten under that. Knocked that ball down. He had the angle on Kronkowski the way he was closing. Two force throws to Kronkowski on that drive. Killer drive stalling. Now Hill deployed to our left with his five touchdown returns. Waiting on the punt by Ryan Allen. And a chance to run this one back. Far side of the 18. But he's bottled up by Matthew Sledder. Circles back right. And contained inside the 10. And brought down. Good work by McClellan and Humber. With a containment by Sledder and Jones on the outside as the Gunners. That is phenomenal coverage right there. Young the Chiefs trailing 14-7. Will start from inside their 10. Early in the third. Rizam marker down. Clee Blakeman is our referee. The former Nebraska quarterback. And the referee for Super Bowl 50. It's gotta be on them. Broncos are over Carolina. There's a block in the back. Return to number 51. Kelly's after this and says it's gonna go wide for the end of the run. First down, Kansas City. Frank Zombo, special team. Four member for the Chiefs. The guilty party. Tony Michelle. 20 carries, 79 yards. And a touchdown for the Patriots. New England leads Kansas City 14-7. After the run in reverse by Tyree Kiln. Then a penalty tacked on. The Chiefs will begin their next series. After scoring to start the second half. From their own four yard line. First meeting of these teams. Week six, first half. Patrick Mahomes 14 of 23 for 164 yards with two interceptions. The second half a different story. Nine of 13. 188 for touchdowns. Gotta get back to the attack mode here. You know, not that you didn't. Hey, he gave up that little screen pass. Little quick run and then the 54 yarder. Now with Hill in the slot to the left. Uncovered for the moment. With the receiver on the outside right. Back to Chung against Tyree Kiln with Kelsey split to the left. Mahomes. And Hanzickles pointing to his helmet. Stands at the goal line in the gun. The quarterback takes the snap. Dropping back against the four man push. A throw out to the left flat. It's got there by Harris to tie that in. He's pushed out of bounds. Kyle Van Noy waiting on the former basketball player from Wisconsin, Milwaukee. Gain of two to the six. He'll flip to the left and he's got to be careful down here. I think Mahomes knows that. He's just trying to get something going. Get something out of his hand. Get into the tie down and let him run with it a little bit. It's a two yard pick up but again it's J.C. Jackson lining up. Second down and eight is Hill. Watkins and Connelly come to the right. Back to the left for Mahomes who stands in the gun. Kelsey to the tie down. Hand down left. Hill in motion right to left. He gives it to Damien Williams. Runs up and then a good play by Kyle Van Noy to spin him around. The Williams fights forward with a first down rush across the 15. If Van Noy doesn't make that play. Again engaged with a blocker. It's a good run. Williams may still be running. That's the best case scenario right there for Kyle Van Noy to be able to just shed that. Eliminate a big run. I know they pick up the first down but you keep it in front of you there. Wrap it up and hang on. Ten yards on the carry by Williams. The first and ten for the Chiefs. From the 16. Bull on the right hash. Watkins and Kelsey line up to the right in a compact set. Harris stands left with Hill aligned to the left. Williams to the left of the hole in front of the pistol. Tens of low snap and there are flags on the play. With a full start at Kansas City. Those are tough to defend. Full start. Offense. We're 75. We're 75. You're our penalty. Still first down. Cam Irving the left guard for the Chiefs who were the most penalized team during the regular season. 137 penalties for Kansas City. In the first meeting of these teams the Chiefs had five penalties. The Patriots had none. We didn't see a lot of that early in this football game. That tight bunch. You bring that stuff down and tight. Those double stacks. That's how you get the rub-routs. Pittsburgh runs a ton of that. Now the first and 15 from the Holmes directing with three wides across the wides out of the field. Kelsey to the right. Williams shifts to the right of the Holmes. He takes a head-high snap. A play fake to Williams and a quick slap to Kelsey. Drops it. Wow. From the run across the 20-yard line. Picked up by Donde Hightower and returned to the near side. But it's an incomplete pass. Smart. Don't take anything for granted. Never take anything for granted. You look at that Philadelphia-Chicago game. You play to the whistle. And if you don't hear the whistle in this environment, the ball's on the ground. You pick it up and go. Smart play. Smart play by a smart football player. Donde Hightower, linebacker for the Patriots. Played extremely well last week but not reflected in the box score. Seventh year. First round pick out of Alabama. Now the Chiefs look at a second and 15. The E40 mark here in the third. Normally it's Hill. On the Kansas City 11. Hill's usually on that bang route. That was Kelsey. There's a bunch left including Kelsey and Hill. Rahomes here in the gun. Williams to his right. Takes the shot, can snap. Pressure from his right-by-flower. Starts to run up the middle. And he's sacked. Three Patriots are there including Laurence Guy. But it was Trey Flowers coming around the right. And eventually John Simon as well with a push on the bull rush. And a take down for the fourth sack of the night. Back to the eight-yard line. It's a double-T twist up front. And they condense the pocket. That's a power rush right there. He ain't fooled anybody with that. You pad into pad. And you go and you bull rush. Hightower gets it going. Hightower sacrifices his body to take three blockers down inside to open up the middle. Now it's an 18-yard loss. You have 13-18 rather after that loss back to the eight-yard line. Got to get off here. Rahomes will have two receivers left. Kelsey on the slide. One receiver right. He shifts Ware to his right in the back. But as the quarterback takes the snap. Dropping back. Spans in. Throws down the middle. The pass is going to be vetted away. Incomplete. Knocked down by Jason McCordy. Huge. Able to reach in front of the intended receiver. Chris Connelly. A terrific play. You understand how big that play is right there. So the kid sits in the pocket. Showing some poise here. He's been getting pressured. He's on his own goal line. He's got a guy right in his face. He delivers a strike on that in-cut to the back side. Jason McCordy who hasn't really been in the plays today here. He takes that off right hand and knocks it down. Coquett putting into the wind. It's a low-line drive punt. As Edelman moves up that ball is going to be fielded by Julian after 50. To the 45-40. Edelman upended. Lands as he leaves his feet and comes down. Crashed into the turf at the Kansas City 37 after the 42-yard punt into the wind. Ball on the right hash with the trips bunched to the short side right. Brady takes the snap. Gives to Sonya Michelle. No running room but he's able to trim the legs forward. And flowers way. Tough two yards. To the 35. A two-yard rush for Michelle. Initiates the clock. Keeps that thing rolling. That'll get you down under seven. Seven into third. The Patriots have the wind at their backs for the final 7-19 and counting here in the third quarter. Complementary football. Defense backed them up. You push them back. You get off the field. Good punt return. And now you've got to respond on offense. Set up by good punt coverage too. Now from the off-side eye Devlin to the right. Nobody had Hogan. Hogan left along with Edelman. Brady under center dropping back. Looking to throw to the near side front. Hogan and he makes the catch. He comes down at the 25-yard line. He took a shot from Steve Nelson. He holds on for a first down grab with his initial catch of the night. Devlin sneaks out wide open to the strength. But it's the pre-snap read with nobody on Hogan. 19-year quarterback is going to go to that guy. Quietly again. Hogan and Dorsett are drawing the fourth and the fifth best defenders. You have to take advantage of it. He puts the ball to Gronkowski. Edelman has gotten his. White has gotten his. They're falling asleep with Hogan and Dorsett. Dorsett got a 29-yard touchdown pass. Sits this one out with Edelman and Hogan to the left. Patterson right. Michelle in the back with Brady. Pulls away, gives it to Sonya Michelle. Runs it to the right side. Tries to turn up field and he's into the arms of Xavier Williams. He'll shove him back after a yard and a half rush. It'll be a second down and eight. Patriots outside the Kansas City 22. See again, it's Hogan split way to the left there. Bump and run. High safety to the middle. It's another good spot. It's almost similar to 29-yard touchdown to Dorsett. With the double move. Come back to that, Josh. Patterson and Michelle depart to the sideline. James White is checked into the huddle. So has Dorsett. He's going to fan to the right as Brady directs Gronkowski. Edelman and Hogan left. White to the cornerback's right. It's a second down and eight. With Brady to take the snap. Throws it right. James White for the stutter step of the 20. And then he ducks down to the 18-yard line. A flag. With a pass interference. They're going to call an offensive pass interference. On a guy 10 yards downfield. There's a conference here. Julian Edelman. No, no, this is on Dorsett. 10 yards downfield. Jye with the officials. Trying to sort things out with the pass caught in the flap. Pass interference. Awesomes. Awesomes. And with 13. 10-yard ten-a-late from the previous flop. Replace, second down. Backs up the Patriots 10 yards. He looks perplexed like, I don't know what the call is. He's 10 yards downfield running a curl. And he flipped it to White. No, he's just stalking. Really. That's tough on the Patriots. You got to respond. To the 33. Again, though, the wind is at their backs where their position. You got to get something here on second. A whole night of the wind chill. And kickoff in the teens. The kick of the football for any distance here. White the single back. Brady under center short drop. Throws it left leg. Caught by Hogan. Makes the catch. But he's wrapped up immediately by Kendall Fuller. And dropped at the 31-yard lawn. That's going to present a third and long for the Patriots. They need to reach the 14 to convert. Tough downs here. It's just one little slip up like that. One call. And it just kills the drive. Game clock under five minutes to go on the third and a 14-7 Patriot lead. Springtime. Hogan, Dorsett. To the right. Balls on the left hash of the 31. Gronkowski puts the hand down tight to the left. Edamon split short side left. White to the left of Brady. Short motion by Edamon. Brady with the give. James White runs up the middle. Bottled up there. Nowhere to go as he cuts it right. And he's dropped at the 29-yard line. Justin Houston making the stop for Kansas City. Steven Gostkowski will come on and try a long distance field goal. In search of stretching the lead to two score. This is what you get paid for. Moments like this here. It'll be a 47-yarder. Wind at his back. It's a big one. You got the wind at your back. Flags at the top. In your favor. You get five field goals including the game winner against Kansas City in week six. Cardona. To snap to Allen. It's in place. Gostkowski swings the right leg. Kick driven to the upright. Down the kick is good. That's money. Steven Gostkowski converts. Big boy kick. And at the 4-0-2 mark. Here in the third quarter the second leading all-time scorer in postseason history is given the Patriots a 17-7 lead. That field goal completing a six-play, eight-yard drive in 336. It was a big setback with an offensive pass interference call. Gostkowski with the pick-me-up. Soon to tee it up to our right at the 35. Traymon Smith again dispatched as the kickoff return man for Kansas City. And it showed the confidence of Gostkowski from that range to go to James White on the handoff to not risk a sack to where you got to back up and then it's definitely a punt. So now you make your adjustments. You know what works defensively. Zone and sit back and let him pick you apart. That doesn't keep going to get the kid. And now Gostkowski begins the approach and swings the right leg. And he drives this kick to the end zone for a touchback. In fact as he clears the end line to our left up against the grandstand wall. Right arrowhead stadium with these fans right on top of the playing surface. Here in the booth Bob and I interact quickly and in real time. And now your students or staff can do that as well with clear touch interface. Display panels from the Okers Company. Innovative. Innovate your classroom or conference room today at O-C-K-E-R-S dot com. That's the Okers Company. Kansas City Chiefs will go left to right. The football placed down on the 25. To the near hash mark. Mahomes the second year quarterback out of Texas to move under center. He's that tight again. Single back behind him. Top back set. Sprinting in motion left to right is Tyreek Hill. Kelsey on the left wing. He reverses direction and rolls left. Now Mahomes off the play face. Dropping back under pressure. Stiff arms for the defender. Throws to the near side. He can bleed. Patrick Mahomes being pressured by Patrick Chung. The big thing with Chung who gets the pressure from the left side. He doesn't over commit and come in 90 miles an hour. Smart. Settles the feet. Forces Mahomes to the side again. Gets a different throw when he's going backwards. If he turns the corner and can square, he can make every throw. Mahomes under pressure in his face. Stack four times. Now the second down and ten coming up from the right hash of the 25. Kelsey to the right. Two receivers stack left. Watkins is there along with Harris. Split backs as Hill sprints in motion onto the left. Mahomes takes the snap. He's looking left. He's pressured again. He steps up. He steps up. He starts to run across the 30 yard line. And he is hit on the open field. And dropped short of the first down marker by Patrick Chung. Tackled at the 34. He saw Kyle Van Noy. A little stunned. In the backfield trying to swap the football away from Mahomes. And he nearly got one. I don't know what people are booing about. They want to call and hit the quarterback. He's a runner at that point. And there's no slide. He's fair game, man. So it's third and inches for Kansas City. Connelly checks into the huddle. The football splits the hash mark shy of the 35. Connelly, Hill, and Robinson to the left. Watch a deep ball. Kelsey hand down right. Single back is Williams. Mahomes sends Hill in motion. He takes the snap and on the quarterback sneak. The youngsters surge straight ahead with a first down plunge across the 35 to the 36. Van Noy is starting to mix it up. He's got to be careful here. No extracurricular activity. That's a good stunning hit on Chung. I think he stunned Mahomes a little bit right there. I don't wake you up as a quarterback. Game clock under three minutes and counting here on the third quarter. And a 17-7 advantage for the Patriots. And with Mahomes in the gun. That punch again. Williams to his left. Two receivers off the left, two to the right. Delayed play fit. Now Mahomes dropping back. Has a lot of time. Throws down the middle. Checking down to Williams. He's hit immediately. And he has dropped at the 40-yard line. A tackle made by linebacker Elandon Roberts. How Van Noy there as well. You hold your breath when the kid sets his feet and he takes a peek. Because you know what he's peeking at. He's peeking at the 60-yarder. And he wants to drive vertically down the field. He doesn't want to throw check downs. He doesn't. No quarterback really does. It is a second down and six after that pickup before. And even when he throws a pass like that. So he's got a lot of time in the pocket. It's an open stance when he throws it. And he has Williams to his right. Now two receivers stack. Love Kelsey. Tight to the right. A handoff to Damian Williams. Runs up to middle and he surges forward. A lot of contact at the line. Williams able to muscle his way for three and a half out across the 43. Roberts and Hightower. Among the tacklers for the pass. In come the little guys right now. Third down and three coming up. Spencer Ware into the huddle for Kansas City. He was inactive last week in the divisional round because of a hamstring injury. Ball placed down on the right hash near hash of the 43. Watkins in a hill. Line up left. Hills in the slot. Watkins on the outside. John Jones to the slot corner. Gilmore on the outside for the Patriots. Kelsey and Harris. Double stack head ends to the right. Ware in the backfield for Mahomes. A third and three snap coming up from the 43. Quarterback takes the snap. There's pressure. The sidearms are thrown. He slings it out to Watkins who makes the catch. Tackled by Jonathan Jones. Stephon Gilmore on the corner blitz. And Mahomes able to throw it. Sidearm for the completion in the first down. Second he offsets that back. You know slants coming. Watkins widens his stance. And it tells you I'm coming inside. Second that outside guy goes wider. He's coming inside. They bring the blitz off the corner. He's a sidearm. Clayborne who came in as a free rusher. I saw the dreadlocks. I thought it was Gilmore too. Gilmore bailed out on the coverage there for the Patriots. It's a first and ten for Kansas City from the 47. Ball in the far hash left hash. Williams sprints in motion to the right. Mahomes takes the snap. He swings it to Williams. Hits it down the run to the 40. 35-30. A stunner step at the 25 to break a tackle. Spins at the 15 yard line. And brought down along the near boundary by Devon McCordy. Good play design there. Damian Williams got a head start. Sprinting right in motion to catch and stride. And the Chiefs are threatening at the 14. And Kelsey from the outside takes this all the way down inside. Just collapses it. It's just a natural pick. Picks Hightower and there's just no chance for Hightower to get outside that. Set it up with that sidearm throw. Wrap around underneath the rusher. Claypole. Now Robinson lines up left. Kill in the slot left. Kelsey takes the snap from the 14. Dropping back. Mahomes throws it to the right. A wide open receiver and he missed him again. He throws it into the photographers in the right corner of the end zone. Overshooting Damian Williams who had gotten behind Dante Hightower. Patriots had three guys on Tyree Kill there. Triple coverage. Into the fourth quarter we go and the Chiefs with a second down and 10. But at the Patriots 14 trailing by a 17-7 score. Going right to left. Trips to the left including Kelsey and Hill in the slot. One receiver Demetrius Harris at tight end. Flucks to the short side right. With Ware in the back of Mahomes takes the snap. Dropping back. There's pressure coming. Throws down the left side of the pass. It's broken up incomplete. And a flag is thrown. What? As J.C. Jackson takes Kelsey to the turf. But they're going to call pass interference on Jackson. Terrible. Going to be a spot foul. Now for the New England 1. I'm not going to be kidding. Pass interference. A 31. Now through the end zone. The ball is faced with the one car line. First down Kansas City. Well as bad as that non-terrible was in New Orleans. This league's got some issues man. This league's got some issues man. Right up there or down there as well. It's been a tough week on Al River on boy. I mean maybe they got Jackson with the left hand behind Kelsey as he reached around with his right hand. But the ball was behind Kelsey. It's coming back for the ball. Ball's behind Kelsey late. And inside. The Chiefs with their first and goal to go for the one. Sherman motions to the right wing. Two tight ends left. Williams in the backfield. It's printing in motion Watkins right to left. Mahomes is going to roll to his right. He's being pressured. He throws to the right and the pass is caught by Williams. It got behind Hightower. Donde Hightower. Had he been able to turn and find the football would have had a chance to make a play on it. But with a pass interference call to set up the Chiefs of the one. They take advantage. And they strike to make it a one score game. Once again. That misdirection in that flood man outside the pocket. Mahomes does a good enough job. Waiting to get him to come upfield. He throws it at the last second. Yeah. No chance with Hightower Williams out there. That's a mismatch. Andy Reid taking some advantage. The outside now. Chiefs starting to get it going on offense. You got to counter. He missed Williams in the other direction before the end of the third quarter. He found him here. Right on target. Butker back on for the point after try. Again in the smoke from the pyro. The snap in place. Swing to the right leg. The kick lifted to the uprights. And the kick is good. To AFL originals meeting in this AFC Championship game. And the Chiefs have drawn within 17-14. After a nine place 74 yard series. With a one yard pass from Pat Mahomes to Damian Williams. Now Butker. Teeing it up to our right at the 35. He runs up the kick at Mark Patterson. Cordero. Linch forward with a chance to return. Left side at the seven. Slash right to the 15 yard line. Patterson to the 20. Patterson will be stood up. And stole. Shia the 25. Pat will have it going left to right from the 24. Got to go. Got to go. Got to respond. Andy Reid's done a nice job. Making adjustments after halftime. Outscoring a 14 to three through that quarter. 14 nothing lead to end that first half. Now you got to score. You got to put the ball in the end zone. Similar story to the regular season meeting. Where the Chiefs awakened in the second half offensively. Now the Patriots. With Edelman. And Hogan. Deploy to the left. And Patterson to the right. Glock is well to the left with a hand down. Burkett is the single back. Brady's under center. Ball on the near hash. The right hash. Breaks the snap. Turns. Play fake to Burkett. Stands in. Throws down the middle. Edelman wide open. Leaps at the 40 with a catch. And brings it down. And before he's shoulder down. By Daniel Sorensen. Great play call. Out of the 43 yard line. It's a fantastic play call. To Edelman on a deep drag left to right. And it's the play fake to the left. But Brady turns the back. He knows exactly what the defense is. And he knows where he's putting that ball. Couldn't wait to get it to Edelman. 17 yards on first down. 19 yards officially without reception by Edelman. Who will deploy to the left once again. Wide side of the field. From the Patriots. 43. Out of the eye. Michelle behind Devlin. Allen in motion right to left. Leaving Gronkowski the tight end right. Brady with the give. Sonya Michelle runs it left. And he's knifed down. Coming up in a hurry. Anthony Hitchens. A run stunt. As a linebacker making the stop for a minimal gain. It's a real nice shot by Hitchens right there. Anticipating where the ball is going to go. Shooting that gap and getting inside. Three point gain. Second down and nine. Patriots in the lead. Trying to add to it. The ball has put the hash marks from New England. 43 and a half. Hogan. O'Fann left. Edelman right. Along with Gronkowski. Who stands up for the right. Patterson. Flanks Brady. Who hands it off to Michelle. And he runs it through the middle with a big gain. Turning forward. Close to the first down marker. And he has the first down in fact. With a forward progress to the 46. We had the pony formation. Patterson to the right of Brady. Michelle off his left hip. Sonya takes the hand off with a big conversion. I can't hurry up here and snap it. I think you got a pretty good spot here. That's a great second effort by Michelle after contact. Had a huge third down conversion on the game winning series in the week six. Just picked up ten. And again he'll align behind Devlin out of the eye. Gronkowski at the tight end right. Two receivers left. Door set in the slot. Edelman on the outside. Brady takes the snap. Turns and gives. Michelle runs it right through a three. Spun down by Xavier Williams. Reaching out with the football. Be careful there. Keep turning. Across the 43. A Rockland Federal Credit Union. Free means free.

Where McDaniels likes to take a peek. And that means that's a shot. Second down and seven for the pass from the right hasher. The cheese 43 with Hogan and Edelman to the right. Gronkowski puts the hand down low. Off set eye. Herc had behind Devlin. Brady dropping back looking to throw. Flares it left. Devlin makes the catch on the run. He chucked down from behind. But a first down. Grab and carry. Across the 35 to the 34 yard line. Do you understand what the precision has to be? To drop back on a quick five. And to throw the ball to a full back. Going away from you to your left. An upfield. An accurate throw. That is a nine yard dagger to pick up a big first down. Reggie Ragland made the tackle on Devlin. First and ten for the pass from the Kansas City 34. Ball now placed down in Lutkash. To the short side go Hogan in the slot. Coming on the outside. Hogan time. Gronkowski tied in. Puts the hand down right. From the eye. Devlin in front of Michelle. Edelman comes in motion. Left to right. Brady pumps it left. Hands off to Michelle. Runs up the middle. Sonny will carry picking his way to the 31 of Kansas City on a rush of three. Got to continue to protect that football. You get that pump fake. Ball slick. You know the temperatures are dropping. You see the breath just coming out of all their faces. Just good play action by Brady. Quick fake. Give it to Michelle. Push it. David Andrews the center for the Patriots. Nephew of Dan Reeves who played in the ice bowl. Coldest game on record in the NFL. The 1967 championship. Now the pass leading at 17-14 in this AFC championship game. Second down in seven for New England. Two receivers right. Patterson split left. Rock is left as well. White to the right of Brady. He takes the snap for the 31. Throws it right for James White. Catch to the inside. White is double-team and taken down short of the 25-yard line. Passed by Kendall Fuller at all at the 26. It's a good job by the Chiefs bracketing that once you know it's going to White on a quick throw to the right flat. It's just a quick bang route trying to get him the ball as quick as he can so he can make a move. Windchill at six. Temperature 17. Pickup of five. It's third and two. Remember, the pass are going into the wind. Three receivers wide to the left. Football across the 27. Edelman now motions right. White is going to shift to the left hip of Brady. He changes the play. Setting the protections. Takes the snap. Hands to White. Inching behind his guard. Tooty runs it to the right side and he's close. James White trying to patiently exploit any opening. Joe Tooty. The left guard was pulling. And Pete Blakeman is going to call for a measurement. Setting the Birkhead. You're going. And so we've watched the place kickers warm up today. Kicking left to right. They struggled. This is the hardest part of the field. That you struggle. And if you ultimately want to get where you think you need to go. You got to be able to pick up half of a yard in this situation. Probably about a football. It's about the length of the football as they stretch out. The sticks. And the change. Send in the bigs. Let's go. Last year. And the regular season opener. The Patriots could not convert. In a couple of situations like this against Kansas City. They've worked all season long. Especially of late to develop. A short yardage running game. The entire middle of that field has been replaced. That's the whole sodded area right down that hash. The crowd noise again. And so it's pointed out several times this evening. Tough to fire off the football. It's fourth and it's. Again baby. Brady get the Chiefs. To jump. What about the snake? Tom Brady will move under center. Burkett is the single back. Brady takes the snap. Turns gives to Burkett. Runs it right. With a lead. Sure. He may have gotten stuck. Nope. Looks like he's short. He got stuck. They gave it to Burkett. No full back. In front of him. And the Chiefs meet him in midair. And a turnover on downs at the 933 mark. Killer. No full back. No Michelle. 17-14 Patriots on the safety insurance. 985 the Sports Hub Patriots. Great enough. The Chiefs take over with a first and ten. Kansas City trailing 17-14 with possession from the near hash. Left hash of the 25. Snapped him at Holmes. Turns and gives it to Damian Williams. Runs it to the left. And he's brought down by John Simon. Good work by Simon on a takedown after a gain of two. Boy nobody went over with. Heel in motion. So heel goes in motion right to left. Tells you they're in zone. So Patriots come out in zone on first down. All placed down on the near hash. The defense has been terrific thus far. Tough to contain this Kansas City offense's heel. Kelsey. Third man now. And a third receiver. Deploy to the right. One to the left. Mahomes in the pistol. Williams two is left. Second down and eight. Williams now shifts to the right hip of the quarterback who takes the stand. Mahomes dropping back. Pressure throws to the right. Firing with a pass to tall. Missing his running back. Damian Williams. Landon Roberts doing a good job for the Patriots. A linebacker in coverage. And now it's a third and long for Kansas City. You got to keep it going now. Now again the pressure, the pressure, the pressure, right? Kid sets his feet. He's pretty darn good at throwing holes. Eight fifty one on the clock here in the fourth quarter. Seventeen fourteen Patriots. A third down and eight for the Chiefs from their twenty seven yard line. Kelsey, Hill and Connelly to the right. It's got to Kelsey. Watkins along with Ware to the left. Now Mahomes summons Ware into the backfield. You got the attack. Gilmore on Kelsey. The quarterback's left hip. Mahomes takes the step. Dropping back. There's a blitz coming. McCordy a lob down the right side. That pass is incomplete. He tried to float one out to the right. For Tyreek Hill. Gavin McCordy on the blitz and the Patriots force a punt. What a call by Brian Flores. What's he do? He takes number twenty four. He knows the kids going to Kelsey on third and ten. So he puts Gilmore on Kelsey. Then all of a sudden the kids looking for the read. It's not there. Then you dial up the safety blitz from the backside. On third and ten. Cole quitting out a punt. Wind at his back. Stands inside the fifteen fields. Pennehigh snap. Left foot to punt. It's high and it's relatively short. In fact it's going to take a bounce across the thirty five. Mishandled by Edelman. Picked up on the run by Dieter. On and covered to the end zone. On the muff. Garry Dieter will recover at the twenty two yard line. Julian Edelman. Hold on. It's hitting on the roof. The officials are going to give him. The possession. At the twenty two advancing a muff. He ran it into the end zone. And another killer mistake by the Patriots in this game. That they have controlled. For the most part throughout. Brady with an interception in the first half on a third and goal to go from the run. And now with. The officials conferencing. Edelman's arguing he didn't touch it. I can't get we can't get enough of a look. Because the ball changed direction. The ball spotted. Here's Klee Blakeman. He didn't touch it. On this one. The only thing in the field is that the receiving team touched the ball. Then it was recovered by the kicking team. There was a muff. No advance. Goal to the receiving team awarded the spot and they recovered it. The ball appeared to hop right over his arm. He's saying he didn't touch it. The previous play is under review. It will be reviewed. I think it touched his right bicep. I think it grazed it. It may have touched his right glove. His right hand. But I think it bounced over his arm. We go to a timeout. An enormous review to say the least. During the break. 17-14 Patriots on the safety insurance. Not eat five. The sports on Patriots radio network. Referee. Klee Blakeman. Still has the headset on. Still eyeing the surface tablet down below to our left. Communicating with Alberto River on it has been a long postseason. And an especially long championship Sunday for. The NFL officials. In New Orleans and here in Kansas City. What was initially. By the naked eye. A muff by Julian Edelman on a bouncing punt. Based on what we've seen so from numerous replays. I thought initially touch it. We saw four different replays. And I'm convinced he did not. It now. I thought it hit the bicep. I know it didn't touch the fingers. Because it never changes the flight of the ball. The point hits. And it goes boom right up in the air. Over the right forearm. I. Did not. Great. Yes. It does. Never never alters the path of the ball. On his. Right bicep. He never touched it. No. They continue. To. No. Rerack the replay on the. Video board. You gotta make a decision. Got football game. Klee Blakeman continues. To converse with New York City in a 17 14 game in favor of the Patriots. At the 835 mark. Of this fourth quarter. They've also got to determine if he. Indeed in their eyes with indisputable evidence did not touch it. Where the ball should be spotted. As Sora as a. Garrick Dieter. Recovered for Kansas City. On the run. Not sure what's going on here. They're just taking a good old time. CBS continues. To show the slow motion replay. Initially it appeared as though the ball may have hit his left hand. But not. One underneath it. And then the ball clearly bounced as we've seen it. Any number of times. Over. His right arm. And as we look at the replays. Oh I don't think. Spot the ball. Here is Klee Blakeman. He goes to Andy Reid. Chiefs aren't happy. And Andy Reid. Pages are pleased about it. Wow. After reviewing the play. To determine that the receiver did not touch the ball. Therefore. The ball is dead. In the spot. Kansas City. Recovery. The ball will be. The wing of the ball at that spot. First and 10. He spent eight minutes and 39 seconds in the game clock. Eight thirty nine. Sorry it's the right call. I thought it initially touched the right forearm. I knew it didn't touch the hand. Because it never altered it. Once the point hit and it went up. And then once you saw the one angle where it didn't hit the arm. You knew it didn't hit him. Well the Patriots. Just caught a huge break. You've got to go on offense. And they have it at the 28. They still have a lot of work to do. Right now with a three point lead over the Chiefs. At the eight thirty nine mark of this fourth quarter. Tappley or gas and electricity.

Big stop by the defense. Though after the Patriots turned it over on down. Now with Brady under center. Michelle takes the counter handoff. Runs up the middle. And suddenly Michelle is contacted and dropped. After a two yard rush. Tackled by Fuller. Coming up from corner back at the 30 yard line. So it looks like the Chiefs are starting to take some chances. To against the run game. Yeah. From that second level. This is where. Deep play fake. Block it up. And sneak somebody behind him on a deep crosser. You did it with Edelman on a previous drive. Balls puts the hash marks at the 30. Going left to right. Edelman and Hogan to the right. Grogowski the tight end there as well. Patterson split left. Michelle the single back. Brady under center. Here it is. Drops back with a play fake to Michelle. Stands and throws down the middle. Edelman off his hands. Intercepted on the deflection. To Sorensen. Thirty five thirty. Slanting left. To the twenty five. Tackled by Michelle. While the punt didn't touch him. The pass did. And on the carrom Kansas City takes over. The karma. Deep play fake. Gets it down. He's a crosser. Edelman. Somebody was cutting underneath Edelman. It's the deep dropper from the middle. That distracted Edelman. It took his eye off the ball. Dave dropped that end. Three times. Once resulted in an interception at the one. Now you gotta play defense again. The defense. Has been. Terrific. Save for a couple of plays. They need to be better. In the final seven fifty five. Nursing a three point lead. Mahomes. And the Chiefs have it at the Patriot. Twenty three yard line. Ball splits the hash marks. Trips to the left. Williams to the right of Mahomes. He takes the snap. Against a four man rush. Firing down the middle. Cocked by Watkins. Sits down short of the fifteen or no. Patrick Chung says he didn't catch it. The officials say he did. In the back he said yes. He's got that reception at the sixteen. He takes. Midway through the fourth quarter. The Patriots dominated. The first half. But an interception in the end zone. On a third and goal from the one. Squandered one opportunity. They turned it over. On fourth and inches. Turning it over on downs. I think we're getting a challenge from Bill. In the fourth quarter here. Bill Belichick. Has thrown the challenge fly. Oh he didn't catch that. Ball hits the ground. Multiple Patriots. The defenders say he didn't catch it. And he did not. You can see it here on the replay. Good job. Good job Ernie Adams up top. Just like on the field. The Entreprenal Pro Physical Therapy team. The Life Care Centers of America. Are making great recoveries happen. To Life Care Centers of Massachusetts. And Rhode Island. They put you back in the game. To Watkins indeed. What a roller coaster. Unable to hold on. Week 6. This place is quiet right now. Week 340. One of the games of the year in the NFL. Now after a thriller and overtime in the NFC Championship earlier today. Not without controversy. These two teams. Separated by a field goal at the moment. Midway through the fourth quarter in the AFC Championship. Gotta continue to pressure the kid. Stay in man. Send him. Get Van Noy on the spy. Let's go get him. That's what got you here. This review should not take as long as the last one. No. No. I mean I don't. This isn't even close. There's such a bang bang play to the ground. Nearside and far side of the field converged and spotted into the 16 yard line. After a view of the play. Ball hit the ground and it is an incomplete pass. Good job. Rich trying to get it right. He's got seven minutes, 52 seconds. On the game block. And New England will not be charged with a timeout. That's a good challenge. They still have their full allotment of timeouts. Chiefs do as well for the record. The ball splits the hash marks at the 23 and a half of New England. It is second down in tenth. Chiefs break from the huddle. Hill to the right across from Jonathan Jones. McCordy shades that side as well. Two receivers left. Nobody back. Cover zero. No deep safety for the Patriots. Williams in the back. Shotgun snapped from the home. Starts from the right. Looks to throw back left. Williams makes the catch at the 25, 20, 15. Jennings got a clear lay to the end zone. Touchdown Kansas City. Again they get it outside to Damian Williams. Untouched. Nathan Day. The Chiefs have just taken the lead. You say checkers and chess in that first half. Andy Reid's playing chess. You're playing checkers right now. What a play call. Throwback screen to the back side. After you get flow going one way. Phew. Never had a chance. Never had a chance. Killing yourself. Damian Williams with the second touchdown grab of the day. Remember the Patriots brought him in for a free agent visit two off seasons ago when he was a restricted free agent for Miami. The snap on the spot. Butkers kick. Headed to the uprights. And the kick is good. The Patriots find themselves in arrears by four. 21-17. Still a lot of time remaining here in the AFC Championship game. A ton of time. 7.45 on the clock after a two play 23 yard series set up by the deflected fast intercepted by Sorensen. And just killed yourself offensively in this game. As good as it's been at times. And it's been almost close to perfect. I mean they're trying to throw the kitchen sink just to get to 21 which they did. They put it all out. Edelman had his hands in a funky way on a deep crosser. It's kind of like the basket catch. Instead of putting left over top. Plucking it. Trying to cradle the catch. Butker tees it up to our right at the 35. Patterson. Waiting to our left. In the end zone. First time Arrowhead has ever hosted an AFC Championship game. The Chiefs try to get to the Super Bowl. For the third time all time. They were in Super Bowl I. They lost to the Packers. Then Kansas City beat Minnesota in Super Bowl IV. A year before the merger. Kickoff right to left. Headed toward Patterson. Under it. Spreading the arms. It's a touch back as the ball sails over his head. Fast as a gig speed network that gets business done. Beyond Fast is technology that makes business boom. Comcast Business. Beyond Fast. Visit ComcastBusiness.com. Tom Brady 19 for 27. 201 yards. One touchdown. Two interceptions. 72 and one. Leading by 14 points or more at the half. That only other loss at 06 AFC title game to the Colts. Just got to go here though. Remember the week one last year. Kansas City became the first team to beat the Chiefs. Patriots after a lead at halftime in Foxborough. Now Berkhead to the right of Brady. Two receivers left. Patterson on the outside of Edmund Hogan. Split to the right. Patterson trots into the backfield. An alliance to Brady's left kick. Play fake to Patterson. Brady drops back. Screams to Patterson right. It's read well. He's able to slip a hit. And then he runs forward right to the near sideline. Shorted out of bounds at the 28 yard line. Hitchens came over. It's a good drive starter. It was a defender for Kansas City who had a chance to really disrupt that play for a big loss. Patterson makes a gain of three. It's second and seven. 731. Patriots methodical on the huddle. Meanwhile, someone has run out of the field. Streaker. Watch this guy go down. Well, he's fully clothed, thankfully. Carrying some kind of a sign. Cut it back up inside. He's got a chance. Two are left. He's been tackled hard by a pair of security personnel. Some others are going to pile on. Hey. Brady's taking advantage of this right now. He's huddling the offense. Get him going. He's standing around watching this clown get carried off. And clown is an appropriate word. I could think of a few others, but they wouldn't necessarily be suitable for this broadcast. Jack Langen. I'd ask what would compel someone to try to pull such a stupid stunt. The last time that happened, you want to supermove. He's been here for hours, somewhere out tailgating. In the predawn hours. Guys hold with gray hair. Just lost it. He's taking off the near side. Crowd loves it. The Patriots. Try to refocus before a second down and seven snap from the right hash. Up in New England. Twenty-eight on line. They have turned it over twice. One to squander a chance to score. The other to set up a Kansas City score. Trips to the left. Block stands up to the right. Right in the backfield for Brady. The winches toward Andrews. For the play goal. David over the football, snaps it back. Brady takes it against the four men. Watch he stands in, he pumps, he throws to the near side. Adelman contacted, looking for a flag. And he won't get it to the 40-yard line. We got a hold back here on somebody. There is a marker down. Personal foul. He's got the defensive. He's got the 95. 15-yard penalty. Chris Jones. The traumatic first down. Jones, who had 15 and a half sacks of the regular season third most by a defensive lineman. It's got to be. With a huge mistake. Handed it. Roughing the passer, came down with a chop. Across the left shoulder of Brady. Did he graze the face mask with a helmet? Either way, that arm action. Yeah. It's the attempt with the arm action coming down. Now Trey Flyers did it earlier to Mahomes, and he got away with it. So the Patriots have it at the 43-yard line with the first-in-ten out of the eye. Devlin up in front of Michelle. Two receivers wide to the left. Hogan outside of Edelman. Brady gives to Michelle. Runs up the middle. Ducks the shoulders. And Bailey takes him down after a gain of two. A rush to the 45. Under seven minutes and counting. Left in this fourth quarter. Kansas City leads 21-17. You got to be careful here, because you might not get the ball back. This could be it for you. This drive. Yeah, it's the action down with Jones. And he's trying to keep that arm up there around the face. Second down and eight. Doors set. Hogan, Edelman to the wide side left. Gronkowski to the right. Covered by Berry. White off the left hip of Brady. Takes the shot. Back in the pocket. Throws a lot for Gronkowski. Down the right side. He lands incomplete. Berry riding on Gronk's backside. Looking for a flag. And there is no call. I mean, the contact is... Okay, so the ball's where? Ball's on the 45. It's 10, 20. 24 yards downfield. It's the contact. All over the back. Holding Gronkowski. You got holes here. Third down and eight. Wide to the left of Brady. Three receivers left. Rock the hand down. This is the tight end right. Edelman comes in motion left to right. From the 45. Ball on the near hashes. Brady takes the snap. Against the three man rock. He stands in. He throws down the middle. For Hogan reaches out with the left hand. And he smacks it. A diving catch at the Kansas City 44. And a first down Patriots. There it is again. Dorsey earlier with the touchdown. You forget about Hogan. And it's the catch with the one hand underneath. And this is going to go to the future. Patriots trying to hurry to the line to snap it. Kansas City and Andy Reid throw the challenge flag. Did he keep the left hand under? Dress Hogan. With some movement of the ball. But he came up. His reaction means he caught it. Kansas City is challenging the rules. On the field of a complete catch. And Hogan was contacted. Yes. Yeah the ball stayed on his arm. Even as it started to score three. It stayed on his forearm. And Hogan covered up with his right hand. What a tremendous play by Hogan. And he was able to hold on. Even with the movement of the football. With the forearm under the ball it appeared. As Andy Reid threw the challenge flag. The ball didn't move once he got underneath it with the left arm. It got stuck in the elbow cavity there. Just the bend of it. The tip of it. It's now moving around and ground didn't push it back in. And again, Klee Blichman. It's in. Under the headset. It's in. See how it doesn't move when he comes back over. He's got his arm underneath it. The ball did start to squirm free. But his arm was underneath it. And he maintained the pressure of the squeeze. There. The ball was on his forearm. See he's got that tip. I think tight. He's got the back. Part of the football. If that ball moves as he's turning over anywhere in that front. Then it's incomplete. You know the other part of it too is in the rod. He was contacted downfield. And then he had the defender on his back before the ball got there. And. See. The ball was in his control. It's literally stuck above the five. On his left front shoulder. Stay tuned for the Shaw's and Star Market Patriots postgame show. Your tailgate headquarters with more than 150 locations throughout New England. Well what do you do if it's fourth and eighth? Mark Bertrand. Jim Murray. They're going to have a lot to talk about. However this one turns out. We want to send our thoughts with everybody of course dealing with. The effects of the ice. After this latest storm in New England. After viewing the play. The one going to the field stands his call. Is a catch. Goes down to New England. Gets it in charge in his first time out. So the Chiefs. Live the fight. Yep. Lose the time out at the 6.06 mark. On the challenge. What a catch by Chris Hogan. The Patriots have it at the 44 of Kansas City trailing 21-17. 6.06 to go. The last time. The Patriots and the Chiefs met. Remember Kansas City had surged in front before New England came back. And now Patterson a line behind. Gronkowski to the right. Brady under center. Hands off. Birkhead runs through a big hole left side. To the 35 with a cut left. And he dives to the 30 yard line. A first down run for Rex Birkhead. As he picks up 14. Huge 14 yard run off left tackle. And Cordero Patterson is your fullback. Off set to the right. So McDaniels even late in the game here with some multiple formations. Get Kesey off balance. And New England now putting the pressure on up. The difference is four after the 14 yard rush by Birkhead. 21-17 Chiefs fall in the left hash of the 30. As Edelman splits to the short side left. Gronkowski and Allen double stack cut ends right. Two backs. Birkhead and Devlin with Brady under center. Dropping back looking to throw. Fires it left for Gronkowski. Makes the catch. Gets outside. Stumbles to the sideline with a lunge for the first down. Nice effort. Able to get away from a linebacker for Kesey. Looked like Hitchens along with Sorensen. Diving to the 19 yard line. A first and 10 for the Patriots. It's practical coverage against Gronk with the safety in the backer. And he still splits them. It's double. And he still has a great effort to the outside to pick up 11 yards. Patu in the huddle. The ball on the left hash with the 19. It's a 5-0-5. Mark of the fourth and a 21-17 lead for Kansas City. New England dispersing from the huddle. Hogan splits left. Patterson again aligned off the right side of the line between Gronkowski and Cannon. Brady gives to Birkin. Runs it left side. Lowers the shorters. And he carries it to the 16 yard line. Alvin Bailey brought him down. Looks like he had that right hand on Rex's face mask. As he goes down to the ground. He just does it with the run. Come back with the play action. Three yard rush. Second and seven. Allen and Devlin report to the huddle. Ball on the left hash at the 16. Brady turns to the sideline. Now addresses his teammates. A lot of time. Birkin and Devlin aligned in the on. Edelman splits left. Gronkowski the tight end left. Allen tight end right. Birkin darts out in motion left. Brady drops back. He throws it for Birkin. Makes the catch left flat. He's good as he lunges toward the first down marker. Ridden out of bounds by Reggie Ragland. They're going to mark him out. He's a big short of the ten. The Patriots will have a third and a yard and a half. Two down territory. At the 4.05 mark. It's called big boy time. Ball placed down on the 11. It's really a third and two. Now they're going to re-spot it. Move it between the left hash of the 11 and the ten yard line. So it's third and a yard and a half. Edelman to the left. Gronk and Allen to the right. Out of the eye. Devlin again in front of Birkin. Don't Michelle. The left. Gronkowski. Motions to the left. As Brady hands it to Birkin. He runs it left. And he's able to knife close to the first down marker. Birkin to the nine. That was the spot. That was the soft spot of the defense. Remember he was stopped on fourth and inches. Should have knocked him. Earlier in this quarter. But another measurement. On the summit of Clee Plinkman our referee. I mean it looks short from here. Can't tell which ones the sticks are on this side. So it might be different. The way it's set away from us. That's not the chains. Chains get moved here. Is in the one. Of the number ten on the far side of the field. Bill Belichick stands. Short of both. Looking down the line. And again the Patriots have four finishes. Sneak it. Remember last year in the regular season opener the Chiefs stuffed the. Stuff the Pats and Mike Gillis Lee a couple of times. Michelle coming in. They stuffed Burkett. Earlier in this quarter. And now. Michelle reports. For the Patriots. Before fourth and inches. With the football just outside the Kansas City nine. Three fifty. Throws it on the clock. The AFC title hangs on the balance in the twenty one. Seventeen lead for KC. Out of the huddle for the Patriots. Edelman. Will align to the right. Hogan and Gronkowski to the left. Brady's under center. Off set on. Gotta go left. Devlin in front of Michelle. Brady sends Gronkowski. In motion. Left to right. Brady takes the step. Gives to Michelle. Runs it right. First down and more untouched. Into the end zone. Touchdown Patriots. As they regain the lead. The rookie. Off right tackle. To the strength. Of the defense. And the push. The push up front. Just took balls man. Takes big balls right here. Short motion by Gronk. He gets the set. And man. Marcus Cannon. Marcus Cannon and your two guards had themselves a block right there. Steven Gostowski trying to make this. A three point game. Twenty three twenty one three thirty two to go. Cardona. Over the football. Allen receives the snap. Gostowski delivers the kick. Airborne to the uprights. It's good. Sonya Michelle. For the second time. In twenty eighteen two thousand ninety. Regular season postseason combined. Kept his feet. Two touchdowns against Kansas City on fourth minute inches. You see the hole. Gostowski goes over a hundred yards for the second time in his. Many games in his postseason career. And they're undefeated this year when he does that. When he goes over a hundred. He keeps his feet. Once he sees the hole. Yeah. And that's tough to do because you're telling you we need a football. Get up there secure it. Just lower that shoulder and get down. Rookie's been big for you tonight. Now the Patriots defense. What a drive to counter by Brady though. Now you got to. Ask the whole Kansas City. I can't take it. Three thirty two to go. Remember in the first game today. The Rams tied it with a late field goal in regulation and then won it. After an interception in overtime. L.A. awaits the winner in Atlanta. In two weeks. The Patriots. Have gone back in front of Kansas City twenty four twenty one three thirty two on the clock. Traymon Smith to our right of the end zone. What would think Gostowski here though kicking into the wind. Willis to. The squid kick which we saw earlier that set up the chiefs great field position. And he does kick it off long to the far side of the field but a chance to return. From the four right side Smith to the tenths. Landing left to the fifteen yard line. Get there. To the twenty yard line. Smith to the twenty five. And he's tripped up and brought down at the thirty two. Grabbed at the ankles by. Obamel and Fonwoo. The ball. You have. Better than fair starting field position. Two timeouts with which to work. Plus that quick strike capability. Down by three. And you get the wind to your back a little bit. Now if you look at the top of the state of the. Show the shift a little bit. At the top of the stadium blowing. From the chiefs from where they have the ball outward. Kelsey. To the right covered by Gilmore. Killed to the left. As Mahomes takes the snap and starts to roll to his right. He throws on the go and that pass deep downfield for Watkins along the far side. Too tall. And it. Lands in the Patriots bench area. J.C. Jackson covering Sammy Watkins. Now the big thing too you get. What's the tendency in this game. How are they calling it downfield. They let some contact go. Yeah with Kronkowski with Edelman. So they're going to look seems that it feels like they're going to let them play a little bit. Second down in ten for Kansas City Ball. The near hash of the thirty two two receivers to the left trips to the right. Mahomes in an empty set. Now wants Damian Williams who's been huge in the second half. The motion into the back. Look like Patrick Chung now has the man to man assignment on him. And as Mahomes takes the snap. He drops back. Patriots with a loop and the throw down the middle caught by Kelsey. No he dropped it. The ball came loose. It's picked up by Hightower. Hightower on the left. No whistle yet. Hightower steps at the twenty yard line. I think it's a complete. Out of bounds. There's a penalty marker in the secondary. But you play. And they're going to call a holding. It appears on the Patriots. Of course they will. Devon McCordy is in disbelief. Who's it on? It's not on Devon. Prior to the pass. Holding defense. Number twenty seven. Five yard friendly. Automatic first down. They call J.C. Jackson with the second penalty of the game. The Chiefs. He's defending Kelsey right? No. That was Hightower with the hit. Man. So the Chiefs have it at the thirty seven. First down in ten cans. The city three eleven to go. Two receivers stacked to the right. Flex to the left. Again Gilmore across from him. Out of the pistol with Hill the tail back. And Damian Williams in the back. Filled from the homes. The officials. The conference once again. Oh man. They showed the replay. And. He's trying to actually rub the pick. To run the pick on J.C. Jackson. To free up the back. It's coming out to that side on an angle route. Where Chung's sitting waiting for him. Jackson throws him down to the ground. As he's being stalked. As Watkins is stalking him. Because it's the flip thing. Long huddle. Just a weird call. Once again. You let the Gronkowski and the Edelman stuff go. Game clock is correct. There's no consistency in the way they call this stuff. It's just. Part of it too is. You get to the post season. You get a crew that hasn't worked all season together. And now the Chiefs. To operate to get out of that pistol. With Williams to the left of Mahomes. Golda's going to. Move to the right. Someone's got to go to. Trips in a bunch right. From the. Kansas City 37. Mahomes takes the snap. Pressure by Flowers. Good to the near side. Incomplete. Travis Kelsey. Sprinting down the left side. Mahomes. Mahomes through it short. Underneath. Curveball by. Curveball by Flores there. Backs out. Plays zone. And. I don't know what he's expecting Kelsey to do there. He's throwing. Trying to throw like a comeback to the left side. Kelsey's on that bench street crowd. The second down and ten coming up for the Chiefs is Watkins and Hill. Move to the right. And again. Jones across. Back in the middle. Back in the middle. Jackson against Watkins. Two tight ends to the left. Harris and Kelsey on the outside. Covered by Gilmour. Williams to the left of Mahomes who takes the snap. Against a five man rush. Pressure. Mahomes throws down the right side. That pass is incomplete. Good coverage by Jay. And it's going to be a flag call. Flag throw. J.C. Jackson against Sammy Watkins. And a penalty marker is thrown. Go down offense. Oh my god. With a defensive pass interference call. A spot foul. This is unbelievable. I don't think he could have played it any better. Mahomes. Throwing down the right side. He's got him pinned on the sideline. There are two fouls against the defense in the play. First little foul. Ruffing the passer. Defense number 53. That turns the climb. Pass interference. Number 27. The ball he plays missed by the foul. First down Kansas City. Kansas City has it with the 40 yard line. Mahomes is limping a bit after the ruffing the passer call on Van Noy. He did the same last week against Indianapolis and he was okay. In the aftermath. Now with 3-0-2 to go after that defensive pass interference call. Another on J.C. Jackson. Achieves habit of the Patriots. 43-0-2 to go. 24-21. New England in the lead. And Mahomes. With an empty set at the moment. Waiting on the cue from referee Clee Plankman. For play to proceed. He threw two interceptions against the Patriots in the regular season. That's a tough call on him. In this game. It looks like just hand fighting between the two. Williams in the backfield. Now to the right of Mahomes who takes the snap for the 40. Dropping back. Stands in the pocket. His late pressure. A throw down the left side for Hill. And the ball is going to be intercepted. No. Knocked incomplete. Nearly intercepted. In and out of the hands of the fronting defensive back. Jonathan Jones with Devon McCordy. Trailing is the safety. A good recovery by Jones. Jones does a fantastic job turning the last second. Watching the hands of Hill. Hill had a step man. Again it's through that double look. Where your bracket and underneath and behind you. This kid is so fast. There's a case where Jones really outran the footballs. Hill was waiting on it. And now with a second down and down from the 40. From the right half. Just snapped on Mahomes. A design roll to his left. He throws on the go. He's right up at the 30 off the pick. Runs to the 20. 15-10. Tripped up. And he stumbles to the 2. It's a pick. So Watkins again wide open along the left side. 2.37 and counting if you're the Patriots. You gotta start thinking about timeouts. You gotta take a timeout. The ball's at the 2. Cause you're gonna need a touchdown if they score. Unless you're just gonna play defense and roll with them. Mahomes into the huddle for Kansas City. The Patriots will not take a timeout after a 38 yard catch and run by Watkins. Hill and Connelly split to the right. Patriots with a little bit of confusion. Nobody outside. Robinson aligns to the left. Mahomes in the pistol. Hands it to Damien Williams. Runs up the middle. Touchdown Kansas City. The Chief regained the lead with 2.03 to go. It's almost like they pulled it. Called the dogs off. Said let him get in. Let's get the 2 minute warning. Let's get 3 timeouts. Let's see what we got. Third touchdown for Williams. 5 plays, 68 yards in a minute. 29 abetted. By a couple of defensive penalties. And now Harrison-Butker on for the point after try. Trying to force the Patriots. To seek to answer with a touchdown. It's a 3 point game. The snap is in place. Butker's kick headed to the uprights. The kick is good. 28-24. The Chiefs 2.03 remaining. Tons of time. It's 2.03. You're actually going to get the kick in. You're going to get the 2 minute after the kick. But if you let the kick go through the end of the thing, kick it through. It's going to be untouched. So you might have a play before the 2 minute warning. 3 timeouts remaining for the Patriots. Zo noted with 2.03 on the clock. 2 minute warning. Looms around the corner. The Patriots will deploy James White as an up man, along with James Devlin here. Butker will kick it off for Kansas City. Patterson will be the deep return man for New England. The Patriots did not commit a penalty in the regular season win over the Chiefs. In this game though, you think about a fourth at inches, stuff, and even earlier, a third and goal from the one intercepted. Plays that loom large. In the waiting minutes of the AFC championship, Butker runs up to kick it from the 35. End over end she sails. Patterson coming out from three yards deep. Runs in the middle of the field. Patterson swings it right hash marks ten. Sliding left to the 15. Trying to get outside of the 20. Patterson to the 25. Patterson angled out of bounds at the 35 yard line. But a good run back for the Patriots with 1.57 to go as we reach the 2 minute warning of the AFC championship. Shotgun snap to Brady out of the 2 minute warning. He moves up in the pocket. He fires down the middle. Edelman makes the catch and he runs it to the 45 of Kansas City. Far side of the field brought down by Lucas. Along with Fuller and with 1.43 in Kotick as the officials allow the Patriots and the Chiefs. Chris Jones got Nick took him out of the 2 minute warning in a hurry. New England down by a 28-24 score. 93 seconds to go from the KC-45. Shotgun snap to Brady. Dropping back with a lot of time. Firing left. Coming back like a sliding catch. Edelman has it on his knees. At the 34 yard line. Hogan who came back with those red gloves to cradle the football for another first down at the 34 yard line. Can't believe Chris Jones took himself out. 117 and got him left here in the fourth. Pats are down 4. Brady with White to his right. Two receivers right. Hogan and Gronk to the left. Takes the shotgun snap. Back in the pocket. He's hit from behind and he throws down the middle. In good play for Philip Dorsett. That hit. He had him. There's late pressure from Brady's blind side. Lucky that ball didn't get popped out and be a fumble. Lucky this is an incomplete because he had Dorsett on a post. D-Ford is coming around. He wanted to call too. Taking a swat at the quarterback right hand as Brady and the Cocks behind his ear. Second and ten for New England. Still three timeouts remain for the Patriots. 65 seconds on the clock. Ball on the left hash of the 34. Gronk and Hogan to the short side left. Dorsett and Edelman to the right. White to the right of Brady. From the left hash of the 34. Short motion by Edelman against the man covered. Shotgun snap. It's a four man rush. Brady throws to the left and Hogan makes the catch. He goes down on his knees with a grab at the Kansas City 21. Clock's rolling. 55. 55 at 54. Stop by Bill Belichick. Stephen Nelson eventually covering for Kansas City. Still two timeouts after this. I mean they have moved the clock. Hogan kind of juggled this but the hands were under it. Is your home heating or cooling system giving you a warning? It's time for an upgrade. Get a new carrier home comfort system.

And the Patriots on the attack with 54 seconds to go. The first meeting of these teams in week six. It's going to go to review. Was a case of whoever had it last. Who's going to win it. And the Patriots did on a field goal by Gostkowski. Now a replay review looming. He's got it. It's a booth review. He's got it. Chris Hogan smothering the football both hands under it. He's already made a sensational catch. The ball moves. With a review. The ball did move but again the hands and the arm are underneath it. It's at right arm. It's left arm last time. Right forearm again this time. Saves him. Made a one-handed grab on a scoring drive on a third down the long play. And while there's movement there again as we look at the replay in the booth. Despite what the fans see here in Kansas City on the video board. I mean I understand why the review. It's as much as it arrives. Maybe we're seeing it with our hearts as well. Looks like Hogan still maintained control. With the arms under the football. And he read along the near side. He's done a sensational job to say the least as a head coach of the Chiefs. After his 14 seasons with the Eagles. One and four in NFC Championship games. His team in the lead here 28-24. Bill Belichick and Tom Brady try to get back to a nice Super Bowl. While they back the ball back to the 34. They're going to stay incomplete. Man it suddenly takes you to a move. So apparently we saw it with our hearts. Yeah but I mean. Even though it looked like the right hand was under the football. The ball moved but the right hand was under the football. He's done enough to turn the body to where it moves on the front of him. You know what I mean? It's down. The right hand's under it. So. With the officials to market back to the 34. Second down and 10 for the Patriots. 54 seconds to go. The Pats had to use a timeout so they have two remaining. New England won twice on the road in the AFC Championship at Pittsburgh. They have since lost to the Patriots. After a beautiful play. The ball hit the ground and it was in keep. He couldn't pass. It was a full time pass. He's down at that spot. He's got one minute, one second in the game clock. And New England does get their timeout back. Through the situation. That's good. That's huge. Bet you at least get the timeout back. After a loss to Indianapolis in the AFC Championship game. With a half time lead relinquished to Peyton Manning of the Colts. In January of 07. Two losses to the Broncos in January of 14. In January of 16. New England. Was in a golden spot here. In Kansas City with the Patriots leading 14-0. At half time. Now trailing 28-24. 101 to go. It's a third and ten from the 34. Don't need it all right now. Three to the right. Brock, Hogan, Edelman. Dorsett left. Wide in the back for Brady. Setting the protections from the Chiefs 34 yard line. Short motion by Edelman. Brady takes the snap. Dropping back. Throws it right underneath. Off the hands of Gronkowski. Intercepted. It's picked off and the ball comes loose from Turvey. Various ward. Karining out of bounds along the near side. An interception off the hands of Edelman. And then an interception off the hands of Gronkowski. There's a penalty marker on the other side of the field. There's Clee Blakeman the referee. Offside. He's in. Wow. Line up for the neutral zone. The five yard penalty lead. We play third down. Did Brady know when he recoiled? Because he recoiled once he got set. And he just kind of slung it sidearm to Gronkowski on the right flat. Did Brady see the flag? Wow. So it's third and five now. So, okay, now you got a shot. Third down and five from the 29. Still life for the Patriots. Gronkowski to the short side left. Three to the right. Edelman, Hogan, Dorsett. White to the right of Brady. 54 seconds to go. Edelman motions across the formation. Right to left. Shotgun snap. A five man rush. A lob down the left side for Gronkowski. Makes the catch. As he lands inside the five. Able to reach up and make the grab over the shoulders of Eric Barry. And the Patriots have it at the four. And the clock counting down. 38 seconds and 37. To the left. Cash market goes. And Brady will move under center. They called timeout. And now the Chiefs take a timeout. Kansas City takes a second timeout. A 30 second timeout. So what seemed to be a game clinching interception through the hands of Gronkowski is nullified because of the off sides call. Before Brady throws a lob to Gronk. Able to reach up over Eric Barry for 25 yards to the Kansas City four. Pins him on the sideline. Brady calmly off the back foot. Lobs it perfectly to the outside back shoulder. And just to think that. You know he's not going to make a play. And this is the end. And you get a deflection. An interception. You get a call. To set up third five. And it's great concentration by Gronkowski to fight. Because Barry once he knew he had it was pulling on the arms. And he just wrestles it away from Barry. Okay you got. Many across the country. All of New England wondering if this is the last go round for Rob Gronkowski. Trying to play one more game at least. How many timeouts we have left? All three. The Patriots still have the three timeouts remaining. And they've got the option to run it from the offset eye from the Kansas City four. Birkhead behind Devlin. Two receivers left. Brady is going to turn and give it to Birkhead. He runs left behind Devlin. He blows his way to the end zone. Cut down Patriots. And they've regained the lead with 39 seconds on the clock in this AFC championship. I mean. What a run by Birkhead. What stones to send it back in and say we push around for three quarters. And we're going to shove it down your throat again. Behind the fullback. But again it's the fullback. It's the guard pull. And it's the surge by Birkhead. If it's not Michelle it's Birkhead. It's white on the screens. It's a healthy backfield. That has helped you come on the road. To take the lead. I'm going to stop there. Take the lead. There's 39 seconds left. A lot of time man. Huge extra point to say the least. Huge extra point. For Gostkowski. Cardona snaps to Allen. The placement and the kick. Airborne to the uprights. The kick is good. So with the three timeouts remaining. It kept the run in the playbook for the Patriots. It did. It did. But it's the chunk plays too. It's the chunk play to Edelman to get this thing going to where you cross the 50. Now everything's off the table. And then the love to Gronk. The guy that really people say hey how's it been there? Isn't the same guy? Same type of plays that guy's been making all along. And it's always at money time. End of last year. End of this year. Chiefs with one timeout remaining. Remember though the Patriots are here in Kansas City because of what unfolded in the final seven seconds in Miami. They have a 31-28 lead. With 39 seconds on the clock in this AMC championship game. Now let's not squid kick this thing right? I mean we're pulling this thing through the end zone. Jeez. It'll be tough to get it through the end zone with the wind conditions as they are on this sub-freezing night in Kansas City. The Patriots have covered kicks well for the most part. We saw them accord the Chiefs really good field position on a squid kick. But it's going to be tough for Gostkowski to launch this one through the end zone or out of it. Draymond Smith stands at the goal line to her right as the ball falls off the tee to our left at the 35. Patrick Mahomes represents the next generation of great quarterbacks. Tom Brady is still the all-time greatest. Gostkowski repositioning some of his teammates on the front line. Keon Crossen trying to get set. Joe Judge communicating to his kickoff coverage unit. Gostkowski runs up to kick it left to right. And he sails this one to the right side of the five. Smith to the 10, to the 15. Trying to get outside of the 25. Smith to the 30. And he's written down the ball came loose. The ball came loose so the play is going to be ruled down. The Chief eventually come away from the pile. The ball marked down at the 32. 32 seconds to go. Now you just got to go out and be smart. You can't not finish like you did in Miami. 32 ticks. You got to keep this thing in front of you. I mean, the timeouts are there. So many deep threats for Cairns. The City Chiefs have the wind at their backs. Hill, Connelly, Watkins aligned to the left. Mahomes in the gun. Where to his right? Hill motions left to right. Again, Jonathan Jones with the coverage there. Two deep safeties make it three safeties deep for the Patriots. So the shot comes snapped on Mahomes. Dropping back against the three man rush. He's pressured. He moves up. He starts to roll to his right. Mahomes throws on the go down the right side. And the pass is going to be caught. A diving grab is made at the 48 of New England. A terrific catch by Spencer Ware. With a timeout by Kansas City. The Chiefs spend their final timeout with 23 seconds to go. So a guy not involved all night long. Coming out of the backfield against Kyle Van Noy. Able to adjust his route. A great catch. With a tremendous play. It's good effort. Mahomes scrambled to his right. It's good awareness by Mahomes to hurry up and try to get the clock there. Even though he didn't know if they wanted to burn the timeout. Because you can't sit there and just put your hands up to the sideline. Make a decision and go. Aaron Bucker, the place kicker for the Chiefs with a season long of 54. Made a field goal last week from 39 against Indianapolis. Now the ball snapped from the right hash with the 43 seconds to go. Chiefs out of timeouts. They trail by a three. Ball on the right hash. Two receivers right. Two left. Free play. With early movement by the Patriots. Mahomes throws down the middle. Caught by Robinson. Ridden down to the turf of the 22 yard line. J.C. Jackson again targeted by Mahomes. And the Chiefs will hurry to the line. They don't have to. There's a flag down back at midfield. Patriots are offside. You had a free play. Patriots. Guilty of the offsides. And that stops the clock for Kansas City. Leif Leitman. Open to the mic is the referee. Offside. And the neutral is going to snap. Fence declined. The goal plays the first down. Well the Chiefs are in field goal range now. The Patriots. The Chiefs are in touchdown range right now. Have to keep them out of the end zone. And it's. 16 seconds. Remaining in this AFC Championship game. But he's got to be careful here too. Because remember. Anything over the middle. Do you have time to. You. And right now on the sideline. They don't. Very difficult to run the field goal unit on. You don't have enough time. You don't have enough time. If you're not ready to go. If that's what they're trying to do now. They're screaming at their kicker to get up there. He's over here kicking in the net. And Mahomes. Did he not catch it. That's what they're going to review. Or. Coming over to coach Andy Reid and Cleve Lechman has gone to the near sideline. Replay official Carl Madsen may have buzzed down to him. For another look. Although he does not have. The headset on. As he moves over to talk to Reid. Once again. So many plays back and forth. It's unbelievable. Good bad and otherwise. And so many stoppages as well for. Reviews and conferences. You've got Butler. You've got Flowers. You've got Hightower. Van Nooyer front. So you got your four down and your nickel behind it. So Blakeman. Coming over to the nearest side. Misdirection. Game clock is correct. At 16 seconds. Making sure the clock. Hey. What's killed you that throwback screen. Right. Watch the throwback. Misdirection. Complete misdirection throwback. He's going to throw something at you here. Damian Williams has scored three touchdowns today. Two receiving one rushing. He aligns to the right of Mahomes. Three receivers right. Connelly. You've got too many guys. Harris to the left. There's a lot of Patriots defenders. Three in the end zone. Three inside the ten. And two. At the 15 yard line. Mahomes taking the snap. Dropping back looking to throw. Mahomes throws it right toward the end zone. That ball fails incomplete. You have three Patriots nearby. Eleven seconds to go. He's trying to stick one in there man. Watch his zone. Butker. Comes off the nearest side. I'd go. I'd go. A practice swing. Man. I'd go man and get some guys back. And he's going to come out and they're going to try to kick it right here zone. That's the thing because if you get hit in the middle he doesn't have enough time to get the next play off. Trying to force overtime with 11 seconds on the clock. Harrison Butker. We saw this. Georgia Tech. Second year plays kicker. Took over for the Chiefs early last year. He will attempt a 39 yarder. Wind at his back. Winchester. Soon to snap it. Right hand extends for Colquitt. The Patriots. Nice. Take a timeout. And remember that Baltimore game at home. The first of their three. Waringly takes his first timeout. And that Baltimore game. Billy Cundiff. He looked at game. And the Chiefs fans are well aware of the postseason history for this franchise. Yon Stenneru the Hall of Fame kicker. Three misses. In the 1971 playoff classic against the Dolphins. The longest game in NFL history. In 1990 against Miami. Nick Lowry missed from 52 for the tie. And then in 1995 Lynn Elliott missed three times against Indianapolis. And now is. The Chiefs and Patriots reconvene. From the left hash. Colquitt awaits the snap from Winchester. Snap in place. Kicked by Bucker. Headed to the upright. The kick. Is. Good. And Bucker. Clutch. Sends this game potentially. To overtime. Tying it at 31 all. But still eight seconds remain. So now it's about. Cointoss. You get it. What do you do? You take the ball and you try to score a touchdown. We've been in this situation before. Harrison Bucker completing. The only people. Game nine. Drive with a 39 yard field goal. What's the last. With eight seconds on the clock. After a four play 48 yard drive. The last time both championship games have gone to overtime. Or have they not ever. What a play by. Robinson. After the play by where. To put Bucker in position. To deliver the kick. That's for the moment exercising all those plays. Kicking demons in postseason history. For the Chiefs. First time in history. Both championship games have gone. To overtime. Jodrell Patterson. Waiting to our left. The Lamar. Hunt trophy on the line here. For the AFC champion. And a bouncing ball. To the near side. Fielded by James Devlin. Picks it up. Drops to the knee. Six seconds on the clock. As Devlin. You're gonna have to take a knee here. Execute a play. At the 19 before Tom Brady. Presumably will take a knee for the Patriots. What a back and forth game this has been. Neither team is dead. Ever. The guy 19 years in it. Doing against a guy two years into it. Separated by 18 years. He's at a 41 year old Brady and a 23 year old Mahomes. Football. Theater. On this championship Sunday once again. Brady takes the snap. And takes the knee. The final seconds of regulation. A lapse in the AFC championship. The end of the regulation. And on core. To the NFC championship. Jackpot. The Patriots. Won the only overtime Super Bowl of course. As one guy. Defeating the Falcons in Super Bowl. 51. Kostaski now out there warming up to 35. On his own. Captains. Are at midfield. Patriots. On the opening point. On to the game. Saw the Chiefs win. And defer. Overtime. In the postseason the NFL. We will continue playing until we have a winner. Both teams are going to have a possession. Unless the first team on offense scores a touchdown. Or we have a defensive score. The timing will be exactly start a brand new ball game. Each team are going to have three tie rounds per half. Good. Okay. Good point. So the head. Helmet side is heads. The tee side is tails. Helmet is heads. Two side is tails. New England again. For the visiting team. It's your choice. Heads. Heads is a call. Matthew Slater. It is heads. We want the ball. He called it. He wanted. We will receive. Before Super Bowl 51 is overtime. And now the Patriots will receive. They're going to be moving left to right. To start overtime. They're going to have to score in the same end zone. Same end zone the Birkhead scored in. Heads twice today. Huh. Thought Slater was a tails guy. That change it up playoffs. Matthew Slater appearing in his 21st. Career postseason game. A heart attack. This is supposed to be a lot of fun. I mean I'm having fun. Overdose overdose. I was having a lot more fun with 39 seconds to go. Than with 8 seconds to go. Two really good teams. Two really good teams. Two proud franchises. The Chiefs have had that long championship drought. But as an original member of the AFL. Of course Lamar Hunt. The late owner of the Chiefs. Late founder of the Dallas Texans Kansas City Chiefs. And the AFL itself. The Chiefs have never won the Lamar Hunt trophy. Named in his honor. In 1984. Patrons of course. Have carried. That trophy. With him en route to the Super Bowl. A record 10 times. But Earl Patterson to our left. Waiting in the end zone. Butcher got us here. With his 39 yarder. Now he tees it up to our right at the 35. 31-31. Overtime. And the AFC Championship underway. With a swing of the right leg. And a kick driven end over end. In the end zone. And beyond. Touchback. That's a go left to right from the 25. Three timeouts apiece. Here we go. Money time. Money time. Is for what? Money players. Winning as quarterback. In postseason history. Tom Brady in his 13th AFC Championship game. 11-4 in overtime in his career. We move under center. Burkett is the tail back devil in the full back offset right. Gronkowski in the tight end. Hand down right. Two receivers. Hogan in the slot. Edelman on the outside left. Short motion by Edelman. As Brady drops back looking to throw. Fires it to the left sideline. Caught by Hogan right at the stick. It's a first down catch. With a shove out of bounds by Kendall Fuller. It's nice. How about Hogan coming on? Talk about money players too. So big in that Super Bowl a couple of years ago. The playoffs last year. Had a quiet year for him. Edelman's gotten up to speed. The AFC Championship game against Pittsburgh a couple of years ago. To propel the Patriots into the Super Bowl. But a very big role let come back. It's his fifth catch today. First and 10th of the pass from the 35 on the far hash. Burkett the single back. Two receivers right. In a tight set. Hogan and Edelman. Door set. A split left. Edelman with short motion for the right. Brady turns and gives it to Burkett. He runs to the right side. He lost his footing. He slipped at the line of scrimmage. Fuller covers up. With a gain of a half yard. You're going to have to hit some big crossers here. It's the chunk ones that get you going. It's actually the big throws in the second half that get the running game going. Where the first half running game got the pass going. Interesting here in the door set. Departs replaced by Devlin. Ball splits to hash marks. Officially no gain. Second and 10 from the 35. Hogan and Edelman to the left. Devlin aligns offset to the right in front of Burkett. Gronkowski puts the hand down the tight end right. Hogan comes in motion left to right. Covered by Kendall Fuller. Brady drops back looking to throw. There's pressure. He moves up. He's hit. He throws to the near side. A lot of contact with the 45 as the ball sails over the head of Edelman. And no call. This is unbelievable. Steve Nelson defending for the Chiefs. It's unbelievable. It really is. Brady does a good job avoiding pressure. And the ball is high. The ball is high. That doesn't mean anything. Is there a holder's air contact? There certainly seems to be a lot of it. Obviously the placement of the ball with the Kelsey call doesn't mean it doesn't matter where the ball is. So third down and 10 for the pass from the 35. Door set and Edelman to the left. Gronkowski stands up off the left side as well. Hogan to the right. White in the back. Go to the right of Brady. Short motion by Edelman. Shotgun snap on third and 10 for Brady. In the pocket. Throws down the middle. Edelman open to midfield. Makes the catch. And then lunges forward across the 45. He took a shot from Sorenson. But he got away from Fuller and Company. And the Patriots have a fresh set of downs. You like Squirrel? I love Squirrel. I'll tell you what. He throws the hand up. It's a look around inside. Brady sees it. It's an audible by Edelman mid route. Hands up. Brady sticks it on him. The Ironman on a big third down conversion. Third down and he picks up 20. Burkett gives way or takes over. Get the call in. The Patriots laid out of the huddle. Door set. Try to get set. A split to the left. Three to the right including Gronk, Hogan and Edelman. Burkett has a single back. Brady's under center from the Chiefs 45. Brady retreats to the play. Think to Burkett. Look at left. He's thrown left. It's back shorter for Dorsett. With contact. The ball is incomplete. Behind him out of bounds. Nelson on the coverage. They're just letting them play. They're letting Kansas City play downfield in the secondary. Similar to the way the Chiefs played against the Patriots. Remember last year. In a week one. I don't blame them. A lot of grabbing and clutching. And that's. That's not even a hole. That's a spot foul. That's P.I. Now you got a second down at 10. At the point of an arrowhead. Second at the defender. 45 of Kansas City. Burkett to the left of Brady. Three receivers to the right. Patterson now aligned to the left. As Brady waits on the snap. Chiefs for the foreman rush. Throw on the slant to Patterson. Not incomplete. Ball's behind him. Hit behind him off his right shoulder. Nelson with a hit. Another third and ten coming up for the Patriots. They showed blitz backside. It's a delay. Hug blitz. Brady reads it. Sticks the slant. That's the sight. Ball's high behind. Need a money throw here. Interestingly though again. Looking for Patterson there. And now with Hogan to the left. Three to the right. Gronkowski door set out on it. Right back in the lineup off the left hip of Brady. Patriots to the third and ten from the 45. First series of overtime. Shot cuts now for Brady. Firing down the middle. Caught by Edelman. On the run to the left side of the 30. He had just enough separation to make that catch with Charvarius Ward. The youngster out of Middle Tennessee State. Unable to close the narrow gap. Having flashbacks to the Atlanta game late. Where they couldn't do anything about Edelman. On the drag routes. Left drag route. Right. That's a 15 yard dagger. On third and ten again. So the ball placed out. Left hash. Of the 30. 20 yards. On third and ten. 15 on third and ten. Now door sets. Blitz to the short side. Left trips to the right. Gronkowski now puts the hand down right. Edelman and Hogan. To the wide side of the field. White the single back. Brady turns. Gives to James White. Puts it back to Brady with a flea flicker. He pumps. He looks down the middle. He throws to the end zone for Hogan incomplete. As he led him to the near side of the end zone. Brady looked down the middle with a pump. And then came back to the near side of the flea flicker. With the Patriots looking to win it with a dagger right there. Chiefs didn't buy it. Give the Chiefs credit. That's a good throw away by Brady on that. Not forcing an issue. On a silly turnover. Three minutes into overtime. Tied at 31. The AFC Championship game. Second down and ten for New England. From the Kansas City 30. Patterson and Gronkowski. To the left. Edelman and Hogan to the right. White to the right of Brady. The towel hangs from his belt. He motions Gronkowski left to right from the left hash mark. And takes the snap. Against a four man watch. A throw to the left side. And it's caught in traffic by Patterson. No, he was unable to hold on. Patterson. Coming down to the eight yard line. Another third and ten. It's that skinny post backside. He's gone to Edelman twice. Spots like this. They've delivered. To the left hash of the 30 once again. Out of the huddle. Edelman, Hogan, Dorsett. Fan out wide to the right. Gronkowski flexes short to the left. White off the left side of Brady. Ball away. Sets the protections. Waits on the snap from Andrews on third and ten. In the pocket. Throws down the middle. Gronkowski makes the catch of the 20. And he's tackled. Caught at the shoelaces by Berry. He's still on it. He's skidding to the 15. First down for New England. Feed the big boy. He is feeling it. It is a slant. He almost, almost stepped through it. The ball is at the tip of the 15. And you're 15 yards away. Third and long conversions. Times three on this drive and over its eye. The Patriots try to do what they did to the Falcons. And Super Bowl 51. Hogan and Edelman to the left. Offset eye. Burkhead behind Devlin. Gronkowski to the tight end right. Brady under center from the left hash of the 15. Pulls away. Gives to Burkhead. Runs through a big hole. Cuts to the 10. And he dives to the five. Tackled with a saving play there. Made to the secondary for the Chiefs. What a phenomenal slash run. First and goal to go with Fuller on the tackle for Kansas City. Mid-run the body movement as he's protecting the football. The ball's on the five. First and goal. Excuse me. Second and a football. On the first drive of overtime. And the Patriots try to make it the last drive of overtime. From the five of Kansas City. Offset eye. Burkhead in the back. Takes the handoff. Runs it right. Rex Burkhead is hit at the four. But he lunges backwards. Backpedaling to the two. I can't believe it. In fact to the one and a half. Burkhead spun around. Backing his way. Second third. To the right hash of the two. It's the fresh running backs that income more. They're dosing you with more here. Waddle checks in an extra tackle. It's all your bags. Devlin is in. Burkhead. Allen. Behind him. Allen to the left. Along with Gronkowski. Second and goal to go from the two. Allen motions left to right. Then reverses direction. Brady under center. A gift to Burkhead. Runs it left. For the win. Touchdown Patriots. And they're bound for Super Bowl 53. What a call Socin. We're going back baby. And there ain't nothing you can do about it. America's worst nightmare is back. We're going to our fourth Super Bowl in five years. Pack your bags. Start our buses. We're coming home Boston. Oh my God. Can't believe it. It's not their year right? It just might be. It just might be. It was Sonya Michelle much of the night. It was Rex Burkhead with the last two touchdown runs for the Patriots. And Burkhead on the two yard run at the 10.08 mark of overtime in the AMC championship game. I mean delivers the Patriots to an NFL record. 11th Super Bowl. It will be New England against the Rams. This time the Los Angeles Rams in two weeks in Atlanta. And there's a guy getting interviewed right now on CBS. By the name of Thomas Edward Brady. There was a report this morning by Mike Giardi that he heard something from somebody inside that. Whether it was Wednesday or Thursday's practice he came off the field and he went in the building and he said. I'm the baddest mother bleeper on this planet. And I concur. I'll double down on that. Today's Mass General Cancer Center everyday amazing players of the game led by. The player of the last 20 years certainly. As Robert Kraft said the other day. Of all time. And let Brady. Let's go to the shell and Rex Burkhead. The two running backs. Michelle 29 carries for 113 yards. Touchdowns Burkhead 12 carries. 41 yards. Two touchdowns. His first gave the Patriots a 31 28 lead with 39 seconds to go. And then after Butcher tied the game with the field goal. With eight seconds left in regulation. Burkhead at the 10.08 mark of overtime. Plaza's way into the end zone behind the lead block of fullback James Devlin. So we talked about the lessons of 2016 against the Denver Broncos in January of that year. When the Patriots lost the AFC championship. Continuity. Stability on the offensive line. And a running game that could travel. And tonight an offensive line paved the way. And the running game eventually finishes. Again with the destination. Super Bowl 53. And they head in. And they're heading in right now. The Patriots heading in. We will have the Lamar Hunt championship trophy presentation. Of course these fans in Kansas City stunned. And this chiefs organization led by Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes. They have enjoyed quite a renaissance after what was a very, very difficult time. I'm back in a handful of seasons preceding his arrival here. I'm back in no sleep mode. I ain't sleeping tonight. I'm not going to bed. I'm going to have a good time on the plane. I'm going to have a good time with this team that we have covered and called games for. And they're going in for the trophy presentation. The Lamar Hunt AFC champions. They're going to have that trophy. We're going to stick it on that plane. We're going to take it back home and give it to Mr. Craft. And we're not going to look at that again. Because it's about the bigger one. And we'll say it again. 25 years ago. Tomorrow. Robert Craft. A long time season ticket holder. For the Boston Patriots and the New England Patriots after he first purchased the stadium. Paid a record 172 plus million dollars to keep his favorite sports franchise home. Preventing the Patriots from being sold to Stan Cronke and moved to St. Louis. Happy anniversary RKK. The Patriots are coming back home with a Lamar Hunt trophy. Which will be handed over momentarily. I mean, it's been a fun game to call. And it's tough at the end when it's seesawing back and forth. And you think, okay, chiefs have it. And then you got to start getting mentally ready. Okay, what are you going to say? How are you going to wrap this up? And then New England fires back. They punch back. They got it. And the kick maybe isn't deep enough. They get a nice return. There's 39 seconds left. She said, I wasn't ready. I said, and I said it then. There ain't no way. I'm not calling this one right now. Not yet. No how. Uh-uh. I'm going to get smoked like we did down in Miami again. And credit to the kid. He drove him down again. This kid, this kid in my home. He is special. We watch a lot of football, you and I. We call a lot of games. This kid's a real deal, people. This kid's a real deal. He's going to be the MVP. He's going to win a lot of MVPs. There's a report this morning. He's not eligible until 2020 for the contract. They have his rights till then. You know, being a first round pick, a little bit different, you know, as opposed to a second round pick. And you see some of, do you have it for five years or do you have it for four? They're saying that type of contract will he'll be the first quarterback to eclipse 200 million. And I think Schefter had that this morning. So that's legit. More importantly, the kid's legit. They put good people around it. It's a fun offense to watch. We've been conditioned to run things a different way and we've adapted. We've evolved a little bit. You're going to have to evolve even more in two weeks. That's a hell of a football team to play. I'll tell you what, you're not going to be able to run it down their throat the way you ran it down KC's throat here tonight. So you got to get, you got to get back to the drawing board, find more things, find different ways to do things. And again, you got two weeks to get ready for it. You got to buy. And that's it. You have a buy. That's the player's mindset, the buy. You get everything taken care of. And I think that's where we've been. Hey, a lot of people on this team, a lot of players on this team. There's been a situation before that understand what this week is going to be like. Yeah. LA doesn't have many of those. Or do they have people running it or the staff? So that experience of what this week entails and how it's going to go. Chid favor New England. And here we go. We're going to throw it. Bob, why don't you throw it down to the locker room as we head out? Jim Nance. It's been a pleasure, people. We'll soon hand the Lamar trophy, Lamar Hunt trophy over to Robert Kraft and Jonathan Kraft in the Patriots locker room. And we will talk to you from Atlanta, Zoe and I, in two weeks. Mark Bertrand, Jim Murray are coming up after the trophy presentation in the Patriots locker room.",

What are they going to do? Probably just hand it off and burn clock. No, McDaniels comes right back, same side. Quick screen to White. And it's a bang bang. He steps out of the first guy, gets up to that second level. He's almost off to the races. That's a 30-yard catch and run by James White. With that first down, Credit Union's Kids at Heart donates to the Team Jack Foundation up to $30,000 to fight pediatric brain cancer and fund clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. To learn more, visit CUCidsatHeart.org. The pads have it at the Chiefs. 38-yard line. Going in this direction, left to right at Arrowhead. Not favorable for the plays kickers based on what we saw on the warm-ups. Real quick, James White had some issues in that previous drive. A little nicked up, went to the sideline to see the grimace. Didn't receive much medical attention, but something to keep an eye on. But he looked pretty good right there. James White coming off a 15-catch performance against the Chargers, tying Darren Sproles for the most receptions in the postseason by a running back as the second game of 14-plus catches in his career in the postseason. And of course the first in Super Bowl LI. Now with a trip to Super Bowl LII on the line and a chance to play the Rams in two weeks in Atlanta. The Pads with a 7-0 lead. 41 seconds and two timeouts with which to work here in the second quarter. Down the football on the right hash, the near hash of the Chiefs. 38-yard line. Offensive line. Now, knocking on wood here has been really, really good up to this point. Pinpoint. What a job by Scarneckia. There has been no toning it down. The volume at full decibels by this Kansas City crowd. Too cold to sit down. The seats are all plastic. The Patriots have handled it well thus far. Again, as a team that lost five road games during the regular season. It's still a long way to go. With New England guilty of the game's lone turnover to this point."

    "extracted_text": "A halftime show including the controversial end to regulation in New Orleans. Coming up next. Welcome back to our Town Fair Tire Studios at 98.5. The sports hub Kansas City won the toss and deferred tonight. Giving the Patriots the football to start the game. Tom Brady and the Off Eds were dominant out of the gate. The Pats converted on three-third downs on the drive. And used up more than eight minutes of clock on their way to the end zone. Out of the eye with Devlin the full back for Michelle. Short motion by Allen left with a reset. The gift to Michelle runs it left into the end zone. Touchdown Patriots. New England strikes first. 15 plays 80 yards and it was 7-0 New England. And on the first Chiefs drive Patriots linebacker Kyle Van Noy got to Patrick Mahomes for a third down sack. Which led to a punt and the Patriots started their next drive in KC territory. Brady and Company were on the doorstep again. Third and goal from the one when this happened. Play fake by Brady. Throw to the end zone. Intercepted into the end zone. Picked off and running it right. Reggie Raglin takes the knee in the end zone. Brady off the play fake. Tried to feather a pass. It appeared to Gronkowski. Chiefs couldn't capitalize on that turnover going three and out before the Patriots punted for the first time in the game. And it was on the ensuing drive that the home team threatened to score. But the Patriots defense stepped up on third and nine at the 22. Third down and nine. Dropping back. Scrambling away from the pocket. He's tripped up and he's dropped back at the 37 yard line. No field goal. Trey Flowers in pursuit with Van Nooy, Claiborne and Hightower. And as you heard Zosay, that sack dropped KC out of field goal range. They were forced to punt, giving the Patriots the ball back with just over three minutes to go in the half. And that was too much time to leave TB12. Brady takes the snap. Back three steps. He pumps. He looks long. He throws it down the left side for Doris Satt. And he makes the catch in the end zone. Touchdown. Patriots. Eight plays, 90 yards. Just two minutes and 41 seconds. 14-0 Patriots to score. And that is where we stand at halftime of the AFC title game. Patriots with a two touchdown lead. We'll recap what happened in the NFC after this. Late in the fourth quarter of today's NFC championship game, the only controversial matter was that the Rams had decided to kick a field goal. Just over five minutes to go and regulation to tie it at 20. LA coach Sean McVeigh had decided to kick that field goal instead of going forward on fourth down from the Saints one yard line. It meant Drew Brees would have over five minutes to drive the field and win the game. And he tried to do just that. And then on a third down play from the Rams 13 yard line, Brees was looking for receiver Tommy Lee Lewis. Third down and ten. Brees from the gun. Takes the snap. Goes to the near side. Hit early. Where's the flag? You don't get one. Early hit on Tommy Lee. Shot pain is all the way down at the ten. Unbelievable. No call. Wow. Not a flag to be found. Not a flag on that play. It appeared to be a clear pass interference type of play. It also was helmet to helmet contact. Sean Payton said at his press conference after the game that the league admitted to him privately that he was right and that it could have been either of those two calls. This game would go to overtime and Drew Brees would have a chance to win it again. He had the football, but he threw a pick and then the Rams would have a chance to win it on a field goal. 103 decibels and they're just getting started as Zerline sets up for a 57 yard try to win the NFC championship game. The hold is down. The kick clears the line and Greg Zerline sends the Rams to the Super Bowl. LA will play for the Lombardi. And that kick was a no doubter would have been good from 60 plus right down the middle. The Lombardi sends the Rams to the Super Bowl two weeks from tonight in Atlanta who they will face to be determined here in the second half. It's a 14 nothing Patriots lead over the Chiefs in the AFC title game here on the Safety Insurance 98 5 the Sports Hub Patriots Radio Network. Welcome back to the AFC championship here at Arrowhead Stadium Patriots lead the Chiefs 14 to nothing. Time of possession New England 21 0 7 Chiefs 8 53."

The only thing in the field is that the receiving team touched the ball. Then it was recovered by the kicking team. There was a muff. No advance. Goal to the receiving team awarded the spot and they recovered it. The ball appeared to hop right over his arm. He's saying he didn't touch it. The previous play is under review. It will be reviewed. I think it touched his right bicep. I think it grazed it. It may have touched his right glove. His right hand. But I think it bounced over his arm. We go to a timeout.

Plaza's way into the end zone behind the lead block of fullback James Devlin. So we talked about the lessons of 2016 against the Denver Broncos in January of that year. When the Patriots lost the AFC championship. Continuity. Stability on the offensive line. And a running game that could travel. And tonight an offensive line paved the way. And the running game eventually finishes. Again with the destination. Super Bowl 53. And they head in. And they're heading in right now. The Patriots heading in. We will have the Lamar Hunt championship trophy presentation. Of course these fans in Kansas City stunned. And this chiefs organization led by Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes. They have enjoyed quite a renaissance after what was a very, very difficult time. I'm back in a handful of seasons preceding his arrival here. I'm back in no sleep mode. I ain't sleeping tonight. I'm not going to bed. I'm going to have a good time on the plane. I'm going to have a good time with this team that we have covered and called games for. And they're going in for the trophy presentation. The Lamar Hunt AFC champions. They're going to have that trophy. We're going to stick it on that plane. We're going to take it back home and give it to Mr. Craft. And we're not going to look at that again. Because it's about the bigger one. And we'll say it again. 25 years ago. Tomorrow. Robert Craft. A long time season ticket holder. For the Boston Patriots and the New England Patriots after he first purchased the stadium. Paid a record 172 plus million dollars to keep his favorite sports franchise home. Preventing the Patriots from being sold to Stan Cronke and moved to St. Louis. Happy anniversary RKK. The Patriots are coming back home with a Lamar Hunt trophy. Which will be handed over momentarily.  I mean, it's been a fun game to call. And it's tough at the end when it's seesawing back and forth. And you think, okay, chiefs have it. And then you got to start getting mentally ready. Okay, what are you going to say? How are you going to wrap this up? And then New England fires back. They punch back. They got it. And the kick maybe isn't deep enough. They get a nice return. There's 39 seconds left. She said, I wasn't ready. I said, and I said it then. There ain't no way. I'm not calling this one right now. Not yet. No how. Uh-uh. I'm going to get smoked like we did down in Miami again. And credit to the kid. He drove him down again. This kid, this kid in my home. He is special. We watch a lot of football, you and I. We call a lot of games. This kid's a real deal, people. This kid's a real deal. He's going to be the MVP. He's going to win a lot of MVPs. There's a report this morning. He's not eligible until 2020 for the contract. They have his rights till then. You know, being a first round pick, a little bit different, you know, as opposed to a second round pick. And you see some of, do you have it for five years or do you have it for four? They're saying that type of contract will he'll be the first quarterback to eclipse 200 million. And I think Schefter had that this morning. So that's legit. More importantly, the kid's legit. They put good people around it. It's a fun offense to watch. We've been conditioned to run things a different way and we've adapted. We've evolved a little bit. You're going to have to evolve even more in two weeks. That's a hell of a football team to play. I'll tell you what, you're not going to be able to run it down their throat the way you ran it down KC's throat here tonight. So you got to get, you got to get back to the drawing board, find more things, find different ways to do things. And again, you got two weeks to get ready for it. You got to buy. And that's it. You have a buy. That's the player's mindset, the buy. You get everything taken care of. And I think that's where we've been. Hey, a lot of people on this team, a lot of players on this team. There's been a situation before that understand what this week is going to be like. Yeah. LA doesn't have many of those. Or do they have people running it or the staff? So that experience of what this week entails and how it's going to go. Chid favor New England. And here we go. We're going to throw it. Bob, why don't you throw it down to the locker room as we head out? Jim Nance. It's been a pleasure, people.
