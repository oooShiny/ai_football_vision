Kansas City won the toss and deferred tonight. Giving the Patriots the football to start the game. Tom Brady and the Off Eds were dominant out of the gate. The Pats converted on 3 third downs on the drive. And used up more than 8 minutes of clock on their way to the end zone. Out of the eye with Devlin the full back for Michelle. Short motion by Allen left with the reset. It gives to Michelle. Runs it left into the end zone. Touchdown Patriots. New England strikes first. 15 plays 80 yards. And it was 7-0 New England. And on the first Chiefs drive Patriots linebacker Kyle Van Noy got to Patrick Mahomes for a third downs sack. Which led to a punt and the Patriots started their next drive in KC territory. Brady and company were on the doorstep again. Third and goal from the one when this happened. Play fake by Brady. Throw to the end zone. Intercepted into the end zone. Picked off and running it right. Reggie Raglin takes the knee on the end zone. Brady off the play fake. Tried to feather a pass. It appeared to Gronkowski. Chiefs couldn't capitalize on that turnover going three and out before the Patriots punted for the first time in the game. And it was on the ensuing drive that the home team threatened to score. But the Patriots defense stepped up on third and nine at the 22. Third down and nine. Dropping back. Scrambling away from the pocket. He's tripped up and he's dropped back at the 37 yard line. Trey Flowers in pursuit with Van Noy, Claiborne and Hightower. And as you heard Zosay that sack dropped KC out of field goal range. They were forced to punt. Giving the Patriots the ball back with just over three minutes to go in the half. And that was too much time to leave TB12. Brady takes the snap. Back three steps. He pumps. He looks long. He throws it down the left side for Doris Satt. And he makes the catch in the end zone. Touchdown! Patriots! Eight plays, 90 yards. Just two minutes and 41 seconds. 14-0 Patriots to score. And that is where we stand at halftime of the AFC title game. Patriots with a 2 touchdown lead. We'll recap what happened in the NFC after this. Late in the fourth quarter of today's NFC championship game, the only controversial matter was that the Rams had decided to kick a field goal. Just over five minutes to go and regulation to tie it at 20. LA coach Sean McVeigh had decided to kick that field goal instead of going forward on fourth down from the Saints one yard line. It meant Drew Brees would have over five minutes to drive the field and win the game and he tried to do just that. And then on a third down play from the Rams 13 yard line, Brees was looking for a receiver, Tommy Lee Lewis. Third down in ten, Brees from the gun, takes a snap, goes to the near side, hit early! Where's the flag? You don't get one. Early hit on Tommy Lee, shot Peyton, is all the way down at the ten. Unbelievable no call. Wow. Not a flag to be found. Not a flag on that play. It appeared to be a clear pass interference type of play. It also was helmet to helmet contact. Sean Peyton said at his press conference after the game that the league admitted to him privately that he was right and that it could have been either of those two calls. This game would go to overtime and Drew Brees would have a chance to win it again. He had the football but he threw a pick and then the Rams would have a chance to win it on a field goal. 103 decibels and they're just getting started as Zerline sets up for a 57 yard try to win the NFC championship game. The hold is down, the kick clears the line and Greg Zerline sends the Rams to the Super Bowl! LA will play for the Lombardi! And that kick was a no-doubter would have been good from 60 plus right down the middle, sends the Rams to the Super Bowl two weeks from tonight in Atlanta. Who they will face to be determined here in the second half. It's a 14-0 Patriots lead over the Chiefs in the AFC title game here on the Safety Insurance 98.5 the Sports Hub Patriots Radio Network Welcome back to the AFC Championship here at Arrowhead Stadium. Patriots lead the Chiefs 14-0. Time of possession New England"

Each team are going to have three timeouts per half. Good. Good. Okay. Good point. So the head helmet side is heads. The T side is tails. Helmet is heads. Two side is tails. New England again with a visiting team. It's your choice. Heads. Heads is a call. It is heads."

Continuity stability on the offensive line in a running game that could travel. And tonight an offensive line paved the way in the running game eventually finishes again with the destination Super Bowl 53. And they head in. And they're heading in right now. Patriots heading in. We will have the Lamar Hunt championship trophy presentation. Of course these fans in Kansas City stunned and this Chiefs organization led by Andy Reed and Patrick Mahomes. They have enjoyed a renaissance after what was a very difficult time. I'm back in a handful of seasons preceding his arrival here. I'm back in no sleep mode. I ain't sleeping tonight. I'm not going to bed. I'm going to have a good time on the plane. I'm going to have a good time with this team that we have covered and called games for. And they're going in for the trophy presentation. The Lamar Hunt AFC champions. They're going to have that trophy. They're going to stick it on that plane. They're going to take it back home. Give it to Mr. Craft. And we're not going to look at that again. Because it's about the bigger one. And we'll say it again. 25 years ago tomorrow, Robert Craft, a long time season ticket holder. For the Boston Patriots, the New England Patriots after he first purchased the stadium. Paid a record 172 plus million dollars to keep his favorite sports franchise home. Preventing the Patriots from being sold to Stan Cronkite and moved to St. Louis. Happy anniversary, RKK. Patriots are coming back home with a Lamar Hunt trophy. Which will be handed over momentarily. Boom. I mean, it's been a fun game to call. And it's tough at the end when it's seesawing back and forth and you think, okay, chiefs have it. And then you got to start getting mentally ready. Okay, what are you going to say? How are you going to wrap this up? And then New England fires back. They punch back. They got it. And the kick maybe isn't deep enough. They get a nice return. There's 39 seconds left. I wasn't ready. And I said it then. There ain't no way. I'm not calling this one right now. Not yet. No how. Uh-uh. I'm going to get smoked like we did down in Miami again. And credit to the kid. He drove him down again. This kid in my home. He is special. We watch a lot of football, you and I. We call a lot of games. This kid's a real deal, people. This kid's a real deal. He's going to be the MVP. He's going to win a lot of MVPs. There's a report this morning. He's not eligible until 2020 for the contract. They have his rights till then. You know, being a first round pick, a little bit different, you know, as opposed to a second round pick. And you see some of, do you have it for five years or do you have it for four? They're saying that type of contract will he be the first quarterback to eclipse 200 million. And I think Schefter had that this morning. So that's legit. Or partly the kid's legit. They put good people around it. It's a fun offense to watch. We've been conditioned to run things a different way and we've adapted. We've evolved a little bit. You're going to have to evolve even more in two weeks. That's how the football team is going to play. I tell you what, you're not going to be able to run it down their throat the way you ran it down KC's throat here tonight. So you got to get, you got to get back to the drawing board. Find more things, find different ways to do things. And again, you got two weeks to get ready for it. You got to buy. And that's it. You have a buy. That's the player's mindset, the buy. You get everything taken care of. We've been, hey, there's a lot of people on this team, a lot of players on this team. There's been a situation before that I understand what this week is going to be like. LA doesn't have many of those. Or do they have people running it? Or the staff? So that experience of what this week entails and how it's going to go, should favor New England. And here we go. We're going to throw it. Bob, why don't you throw it down to the locker room as we head out. Jim Nantz. It's been a pleasure, people. We'll soon hand the Lamar Trophy, Lamar Hunt Trophy over to Robert Kraft and Jonathan Kraft in the Patriots locker room. And we will talk to you from Atlanta. Zoe and I in two weeks. Mark Bertrand and Jim Murray are coming up after the trophy presentation in the Patriots locker room."
